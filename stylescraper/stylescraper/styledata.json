{"name": ["Spanish Golden Age"], "descriptions": [["Spanish Golden Age Fashion", " was characterized by its opulence and luxurious style, matching the wealth and power of the Spanish nobility of the time. The use of expensive fabrics like silk, velvet, and satin was common, as well as intricate embroidery, lace, and jewels. Generally, a person's fashion choice often could \"read into\" one's social and laboral status through elaborate clothing and accessories. Religious motifs were also common in the clothing, due to its important influence. Motifs such as rosaries, crosses and images of saints were commonly found, especially in women's dresses, because modesty and purity were seen as fundamental feminine traits. Along with this, Gender roles were a fundamental value of the society, so men wore loose-fitting garments with intricate details, while women wore more restrictive clothing that traditionally represented modesty. Another important key feature of the fashion worn during the Spanish Golden Age were the regional and historical influences. Since Spain was a recently unified country at the time, pretty all the regions had pretty distinct cultural backgrounds (for example; the Castilians, Aragonese, Granadians/Andalusians, Catalans, Basques, Navarrans, Galicians, Asturians, Leonese, Valencians, etc. - All of these regions had their differences due to the fact they were distinct kingdoms before unification), and this obviously contributed to the sense of fashion in Spain during the 16th and 17th century. The north of Spain was stereotypically considered to be more modest, conservative, religious and 'cultured', while the south of Spain was considered romantic and warm. Southern fashion also included north African and Andalusi influences such as Moorish-inspired patterns and colours, reflecting the long standing Muslim heritage of the south.

Press and Brooks Brothers both had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical Preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as polo, sailing, hunting, fencing, crew rowing, lacrosse, golf, tennis, rugby, squash and swimming. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in Preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories.

These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style.

Elements of the Victorian and Romantic fashion influence the more fanciful interpretation of the style, creating the look of a Gothic novel character or of an eccentric dandy.

Blush was diagonal and was orange, brown, or yellow. Bodikon women also had relatively thick (and slightly bushy) eyebrows -  it was mainstream to draw them much thicker than your own eyebrows. What was often done was drawing thick and dark straight eyebrows from the inside of the eyebrow to the end of the eyebrow using eye shadow, which couldn’t be as easily done with an eye pencil. Grey and dark brown eyebrow pencils were preferred for eyebrows around this time regardless of hair colour. After the Bubble burst, by the mid-1990s most women had very thin eyebrows - this process sped up when Tony Tanaka, a makeup artist, taught Japanese women the concept of trimming. In the Bubble period, women also had a strong    self-assertion, so it was said that it was better to have flashy make-up - it was not possible to easily look fashionable with a more “natural” make-up.\n", "Some Make-Up tutorials to help you out!!", " \n", "-> ", "https://youtu.be/jcA8b4L6T1g", " (", "This one has English subtitles, and is probably the most useful one.

At least 60% of women in their twenties kept their hair longer than their hip area by the early 1990s.The hairstyle that most Bodikon women wore by far throughout the Bubble was the ", "“One-Length” or “Wanren” hairstyle", "  (", "Wanren, ", "ワンレンボブ", "). This was where the hair was cut all in one length to create a mature, professional look, and was (extremely) straight and long. This hairstyle was popularised by idols such as Chisato Moritaka, and directly contrasted the “Seiko-chan” look of the early 1980s (popularised by Seiko Matsuda). The “Wanren” hairstyle was often paired with bodycon dresses or a power suit to form the “", "Wanren Bodikon", "” (", "ワンレン・ボディコン", ") set - this “set” was a crucial look in the Bodikon style and is often one of the most famous mental images of the Bubble Economy to many      Japanese people. The Wanren Bodikon set attracted a lot of attention from onlookers during the time. Wanren hairstyles were often paired with a type of bangs known as “", "Tosakamaegami”", " (", "とさか前髪", ") bangs - literally “rooster hair” in Japanese - that could either be straight or curled, and sat at the top of the head. These bangs were upright “like chicken combs”, with the bangs slightly hung down and sprayed to keep them in place. As with any fashion that originated in the 1980s, hairspray was a Bodikon girl’s must-have and many women wrapped their bangs in curlers, slept, and then the next morning, used a hairspray to keep the bangs in place before going out. Wanren hairstyles didn’t always have Tosakamaegami bangs, but it was very common. However in the early 1990s during Bodikon’s final years the Wanren hairstyle did soften and Tosakamaegami bangs started to be worn with the Wanren hair less and less. This kind of look can be seen on Makino Tsukushi in the early 1990s volumes of Yoko Kamio’s Boys Over Flowers manga (Hana Yori Dango, ", "花より男子", "). Another type of popular Bodikon hairstyle was the “", "Sauvage/Sovereign hairstyle", "”  (", "ワンレンソバージュ", "). With Sauvage meaning “wild” in French, this was a natural wave perm hairstyle with fine waves throughout the hair and lots of volume. This hairstyle was extremely popular in the mid-to-late 1980s and can basically be described as a Wanren hairstyle that was curlier. As Bodikon fashion’s heyday years were before the “Chapatsu boom” (", "茶髪/ちゃぱ", ") of the mid-1990s (when dyed brown hair, nicknamed “Tea Hair” due to its colour, went mainstream), most Bodikon women had black hair. However during the ", "radicalisation", " of Bodikon around 1993-1994 (when Bodikon fashion started to become its most extreme and begin to resemble Gyaru), dyed shades of brown and even blonde hair became notable amongst Bodikon women, including famous AV idol Ai Ijima.\n", " \t", " \t", " \t", " \t\t \t\t \t\t \t", " ", "Clothing", "[", "]", "With regards to clothing, the iconic Bodycon dress was extremely popular. It was generally considered the signature clothing piece of the style. It was almost always a neon or a generally colourful colour (the most popular colours were red or yellow) and was a mini dress that emphasized the lines of the body, capturing the femininity of the body. The Bodycon dresses of the Bubble period were characterised by being flashy and conspicuous, and the neon colours of the bodycon stood out even in central Tokyo at night. The more highly exposed bodycon dresses attracted a lot of attention from men. Encouraged by the “fitness craze” that was ongoing in 1980s Japan, young women dieted in order to wear bodycon and kept a sharp body. Bodikon women also had a high level of confidence in themselves by wearing bodycon. Bodycon dresses at the time were characterised by their clear appearance of cleavage, waist, and hip lines. The chest was often “wide open”, as women were encouraged during the Bubble to expose their cleavage, and the length of the skirt along the hip line was up to the thighs. It was initially only worn in discothéques and disco halls, before then being popularised as fashion wearable on the street by around December of 1985. Many Bodycon dresses at the time were sleeveless, and so there were a variety of bras worn by Bodikon women. Some women wore strapless bras, and some even wrapped bras with “bleached” colours to make the shape of the bust look good. Colours and patterns of bodycon dresses varied, but the most popular was a vivid bright red that matched the colour of the lips with the colour of the bodycon. In addition, there were many flashy colours such as yellow, pink, and purple, and by the early 1990s it was common to see women wearing “wild pattern bodycon”, such as leopard prints and zebra patterns. Sequin bodycon dresses were very popular, with blue sequins being especially popular. Women wore Bodycon dresses for a number of reasons; these included attracting rich men, not caring about men’s opinions at all and going all out crazy, or feeling confident and self-assertive in clothes that flattered their bodies. \n", "With regards to shoes, they were almost always high heels, usually being black and décolleté in leather with medium heel for a classy look. \n", " \t", " \t", " \t", " \t\t \t\t\t", " \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t", "A modern Bodikon woman flaunts her “Juli fan” for the camera", " \t\t \t", " ", "Furs, feather boas and a lot of gold jewellery would be worn alongside Bodycon dresses, often with luxury bags (such as Louis Vuitton or Versace bags) and gold chains. Chunky gold jewellery was very common and would be worn all over the chest area of the  Bodikon woman. \n", "There were numerous styles of Bodycon dresses, including the “Sexy Bodycon” style of string-bikinis and transparent dresses popular in clubs but inappropriate to wear on the street, but the most popular style, particular for daytime usage, was the One-Line style (", "ワンレン・ボディコン", "),  which was a little bit more conservative than today’s Western bodycon, but was intended to be a “mature” and “sophisticated” style with a closely-fitting dress, or a suit-set, that was usually in one bright colour and uniform enough to pass for office-wear. The One-Line style (or ", "Wanren Bodikon", " in Japanese) was the type preferred for the daytime activities of Bodikon gals, and is also known as the ", "Daytime Variant.", "  The One-Line style included the meticulous usage of the “power suit”, often colourful and with shoulder pads. This was considered a status symbol of business success for women, a highly desirable attribute amidst the success of the Bubble Economy.

Women wore neon-coloured string bikinis, transparent dresses as well as neon miniskirts, microbikinis and spandex, as well as extremely tight bodycon dresses with very short hemlines and often cut with revealing sections. By 1993-1994, neon-coloured PVC clothing, such as hot pink PVC miniskirts, were also highly popular in the disco scene. Pasties and string panties were often worn, sometimes even on the street. Women also wore large, customised belts and had long, often white gloves for a glamorous effect. Some of the more “radical” women - especially at Akasaka’s Ronde Club - even brought whips as dance accessories. Tanning was a major part of the radical look - along with dyed blonde and brown hair. The “Sexy Bodycon” look was popularised by influential celebrities in the Japanese media at the time - these include Ai Iijima, an AV idol who featured prominently on the late-night TV show “Gilgamesh Night” and  was a mainstream celebrity in Japan - men wanted her and women tried desperately to copy her sexy antics. Additionally, there was also Natsuki Okamoto, a race girl, who helped to popularise this sexy version of the bodycon look, even adding her own touch to the style with the “high-leg” look, which was a bathing suit cut to reveal all the thigh and hip. By mid-1994, Bodikon women were also utilising chokers in their look, and inspirations for nightlife clothing borrowed from popular anime characters such as Sailor Moon in style. \n", " \t", " \t", " \t", " \t\t \t\t\t", " \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t", "Spandex miniskirts - a popular look in early 1994", " \t\t \t", " ", "Miniskirts were also popular, being usually paired with long stockings and gold chains, and were popular in both summer and winter. \n"]], "rel_aesthetics": [["City Pop", "Italo Disco", "Takenokozoku", "Raver", " ", "Gyaru", " (successor)", " ", "Kogal", " (successor)"]], "key_colors": ["Neons, bright colours"], "brands": []},
