Art Deco,"Art Deco fashion followed a lot of the same rules laid out for its art and architecture, introducing lots of geometric shapes, long lines, and exaggerated accessories. Art Deco fashion included lots of evening gowns, skirts, hats, and bias-cut dresses. For women, the Art Deco period was the time of the ""flapper""; a woman who bobbed their hair, loved jazz music, wore excessive make-up, drank, smoked, drove, had casual sex, and generally took a proverbial piss on social norms at the time. The Flapper sub-aesthetic in Art Deco was forever immortalized by the legendary cartoon character, Betty Boop.

Cagole,"Cagole ,fashion doesn't differ much from the usual 2000s bimbo fashion. Hair is long, straightened and either of a natural colour or dyed blond. Tanned, hairless skin is the norm - it is often covered in thick foundation mismatching the wearer's carnation, giving it that infamous cakey look. Concerning makeup, blue or white eyeshadow is associated with a kohl liner, and lips are over-lined with a nude lip pencil. Jewelry is common: garish necklaces, ear hoops and philtrum piercings to name but a few items.
,Clothing is revealing, with little cleavage coverage, low cuts and sometimes exposed underwear. Regular outfits frequently include the following: pencil skirts, skinny jeans, yoga pants, leopard fur patterns, tight dresses, tank tops, stiletto heels, fur boots.

Anti-Fashion,"Anti-Fashion applies to many trends, but anything in the trend made ,avant-garde, or misused can work. The feel of the trend without the effort usually involves some element of drugs or carelessness.  Anti-Fashion is, more of then than not, done to completely go against established fashion trends until the fashion world, eventually, co-opts the fashions of the Anti-Fashion world and attempt to make it trendy and cool, which inevitably forces the Anti-Fashion world to evolve and change.

Nazi Chic,"Nazi Chic fashion often borrows heavy elements from Nazi fashion (thanks in part to individuals like Hugo Boss and Coco Chanel and their ties to the Nazi Party) of the day and make nods to the many ""accomplishments"" of the Nazi Party during their run in the 30's and 40's, but it's surprisingly become popular in Asian countries, especially in Japan and Hong Kong (which, given the fact Japan were allies of the Nazis in World War II, it's not too surprising they might still show sympathies to them in the modern era).  Often times, though, the Nazi Chic aesthetic is merely used in cosplay to invoke the look of a particular character who might be a stand-in for the evils of fascism in a particular work (this is more commonly done in the realm of anime and manga due to the full scope of what the Nazis did not really being taught in Japanese high schools, along with some of the more evil elements of Japan's actions during the same time like The Nanking Massacre).

Tropical,"Tropical fashion can go in any multitude of directions, but it's generally agreed upon that Tropical clothing is usually very lightweight and breezy.
,For younger people, there might be a nod towards the Surfer look, such as oversized t-shirts, beach waves, beach bags, and a carefree attitude. These characteristics also tie into stereotypical surfer vibes, which are a large sum of the origin of this aesthetic. Many women may opt for swimsuits or bikinis or even wetsuits if they are also surfers.
,For the more well-to-do, there is Resort wear ,(also known as cruise wear), is a fashion style that was initially only for customers of affluence who would travel abroad around Christmas and New Year's to warmer climates, but has since become a more common fashion aesthetic with the increase of both volume and accessibility in air travel. Resort wear is signified by its lightweight material, ease of cleaning, and don't need to be ironed at all. The look of resort wear can include a ,Nautical, theme, Hawaiian prints, Mediterranean colors, and overall bright floral patterns combined with oversized hats, sunglasses, swimsuits, and open-toed shoes. Despite the ease of access to Resort wear for regular people, it can still be a signifier of relaxation, affluence, appreciation of nature, and a sharp sense of style. Even though there are stores that specialize in Resort wear (like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and Tommy Bahama), individual fashion houses will still create Resort wear lines in their individual collections (like Chanel, Prada, Marc Jacobs, and Michael Kors).
,For older men, there is the ,Vacation Dadcore, aesthetic, while older women may identify with the ,Coastal Grandma, lifestyle.

Yé-yé Girl,"The ,Yé-yé Girl Fashion, was all about social rebellion and modernization: at the time, western societies started to become less restrictive of women's fashion. So, Yé-yé fashion included innovative feminine fashion elements like miniskirts, tight dresses, and bold colours. Hairstyles were also an important part of the typical Yé-yé look: they often featured long bangs covering the forehead, and the hairstyles in general typically included long straight hair, ponytails, bob hairs or beehive cuts. In fact, long bangs were so popular within the Yé-yé subculture that some adults nowadays still associate them with it. Makeup was also an important part of the general look, as it was becoming more socially acceptable. The fashion style associated with Yé-yé could be described as 'effortlessly chic'., ,

There are also many medical accessories such as Band-Aid hair clips, syringe necklaces, and pill bracelets due to the nature of the aesthetic.  
,Makeup is worn regardless of gender in Yami Kawaii in order to archive a sickly look by applying pink or red blush right under the eyes instead of the traditional use on the apple of the cheeks, and is often further exaggerated by enchanting the natural eye bag line. Lips are usually kept very simple but gradients are also very popular.

Western," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Cowboy boots with spurs, 		 	, ,Western fashion typically includes organic fabrics and warm tones. Fashion often revolved around utility and practicality for outdoor work. Leather, cowboy boots, and wide-brimmed hats mark some of the key characteristics of Western fashion. Brimmed hats were a cowboy's most important piece of clothing, as they helped keep the elements out of their eyes and face when riding or doing any other work. Cowboys often took extra care into upkeeping the quality of their hats, often owning hat brushes or taking them into town to get them reshaped or repaired. Good quality hats were often a family heirloom that could be passed down for many decades. 
,Modern rodeo fashion often includes bright colors, elaborate embroidery, and the usage of decorative rhinestones in order to distinguish different riders.

Viking,"Their clothing would be warm, made of linen and wools. With the natural dyes available and how they traveled and traded with many places, it is likely they had access to a full rainbow of colours. Women wore strap dresses with a smock underneath. The straps may be attached by brooches with strings of beads between them. Men wore a tunic and trousers. Both would wear capes for warmth, and leather shoes.

Villaincore,"Villaincore, fashion can involve any clothing suitable for villainy; you are your own ruler and you deserve to look like your own ruler.
,Villaincore outfits can be varied, as some people like to go for a ""cartoon villain"" style (e.g. an evil scientist), while others would prefer a more realistic villainous sense of fashion, for example a more royal style. Villaincore outfits don't need to relate to royalty, even if they are often associated with it; it is about wearing whatever makes ,you, feel like the one in control.

Urbancore,"Urbancore fashion draws heavily from ,Skater,, ,Art Hoe,, ,Hip-Hop, and ,Nostalgiacore, fashion, since this aesthetic is fairly active, a lot of the clothing is fashionable and breathable. A very particular kind of Urbancore fashion, ,Streetwear,, is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s. It grew from Californian ,surf, and ,skate, culture to encompass elements of sportswear, ,hip-hop,, ,punk, and ,Japanese street fashion, and continued to grow and evolve from there.  
,This style can also be closely related to the ,Baddie, aesthetic, which gravitates to brands like Nike, Jordan, and Louis Vuttion. This style includes:
,Some Urbancore staples are:
,Baggy pants or sweatpants (sometimes highly decorated with different textiles),
,Brand-name oversized t-shirts/vintage brand name t-shirts,
,Dad hats/caps,
,Fanny packs,
,Short bubble/puffer jackets,
,Customized pants,
,Sports bras/racerback bras,
,Overalls,
,Brightly colored socks,
,Sneakers (usually Nike or Jordan) or flat-bottomed skating shoes,
,Sweaters over collared shirts,
,Chains/pants chains,
,Cargo pants,
,Flannels,
,Plaid skirts,
,Zippers and belts. LOTS of zippers and belts,Techwear,[,], 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Techwear outfit, 		 	, ,Main article: ,Techwear,Also popular in Urbancore is ,Techwear,, clothing that serves a functionality other than acting as a body covering. This may include waterproofing or extra pockets. Its main influence is ,cyberpunk, and the colour palette is often monochromatic. Techwear elements can include:
,Shells,
,Rain coats,
,Fanny packs,
,Gore-tex or RIP-stop fabric trousers,
,Taped hoodies,Hypebeasts,[,], 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Hypebeasts dressed in Off-White, 		 	, ,Hypebeasts, are those, usually male, who collect limited-edition streetwear labels like Supreme, Palace, BAPE, Off-White and Yeezy. The clothes they buy are not defined really by their price, but mainly by their rarity. Because of such a high demand for limited edition items by some streetwear brands, retailers employ bouncers to manage crowds who are prepared to queue on the street for hours to buy the latest thing. Because of this demand, there is also an online market of reselling hypebeast stuff.
,Hypebeasts usually wear clothing items that people would consider "",drip,"". This style is somewhat looked down on in the fashion community because of its ""big logo + hype shoes = fashion"" mentality. This look can include:
,Cargo pants (bright or dark colors),
,Bucket hats (very popular amongst the high-end streetwear community),

Twee,"Fashion is heavily influenced by the styles of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  
,On screen, twee fashion tends to be influenced by the ""character uniforms"" common in Wes Anderson's films, a practice which was influenced by the films of Jean-Luc Godard. A young school girl, for example, wears a white blouse, pleated skirt, knee socks, and Mary-Janes. 
,Patterns, are incredibly important in the Twee aesthetic, and can often be contrasted with each other. Polka dots, stripes, herringbone, etc. are some examples, but Twee fashion companies often create their own novelty patterns, such as ones with cats, flowers, food, etc.

Trad Goth," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Trad Goth girl school photo, 		 	, ,It’s important to note that 80s Goth styles were far more varied than they became popular in the 90s. There was no restriction to black or dark colors and different bands evolved different looks. Because of this and because Goth is mainly a musical scene, it’s possible for a Trad Goth to dress in any way they want to, particularly since the scene has had so many different looks and aesthetic facets.     
,In the 80s, they tended towards stereotypical Batcave and Trad Goth styles, Deathrock (which is a somewhat more punk variant), or the nameless ethereal, romantic, and bohemian type styles now grouped under Woodland Goth and Ethereal Goth.

Thrasher,"For most, dressing like a thrasher is pretty easy; it usually consists of a band tee (sometimes with the sleeves removed), some jeans (but usually shorts, especially in the summer), a pair of sneakers and some long hair. However, some people go above and beyond and create a ,battle jacket, comprised of many patches from several bands. While this exists in all metal subgenres to varying degrees, thrashers and death metalheads create the article of clothing most commonly, with black metal falling close behind and punks doing it in a slightly different fashion.
,Another less common but still prevalent item is the bullet belt (bandolier), which is exactly what it sounds like. This is arguably the most expensive item in the thrasher arsenal, with authentic ones running for over $100 each.

Trashcore,"Trashcore fashion is very similar to ,crustpunk,. There isn't a sense of anarchy to trashcore, but ripped clothes that are either homemade or from the thrift shop are common. T-shirts with doodles or weird phrases scribbled on with marker is something you'll see in Trashcore. You'll also see a lot of references to opossums, rats, raccoons, and other animals who seem to thrive in ,urban, and suburban settings.  It can also incorporate things such as ribbons, pearls, corsets, feathers, rosaries, discolored lace, worn-out silk, or anything that, many years ago, would've been considered in fashion but have been so worn down by time that it can't even be salvaged in even a "",Vintage,""-inspired aesthetic.

Teddies,"Teddies wore New Edwardian suits, which had tapered trousers and long jackets.,[4], Bootlace ties, bright green or pink socks, and crepe-soled shoes ('Brothel Creepers') also became a part of this look.,[5], Despite the classy look, their clothes tended to be thrifted.
,Teddy Girls,[,],Mary Toovey, one of the original Teddy Girls, described the fashion as “Turn-up jeans, a coat and something to tie around your neck, those were the Teddy Girl essentials. My friends and I would buy similar clothes when we shopped on the Portobello Road. It was all second hand then, we couldn’t afford new.”,[6], Teddy Girls tended to look more androgynous than feminine.

Techwear,"Techwear mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing. Arguably started by Errolson Hugh and Michaela Sachenbacher, the founders of Munich-based label Acronym, techwear became more popular after Hugh teamed up with Nike to relaunch their dormant outerwear sub-brand ACG. Techwear is inspired by the ,Karasu Zoku, subculture and the Japanese Mode movement that followed it. Much of the color palette is black like the former (though other dark colors aren't uncommon), but the forms and patterns of techwear more closely resemble those of the latter. Additionally, techwear draws heavily from the fabrics and innovations of industrial, scientific, paramilitary and ninja apparel. Techwear pieces are often baggy, and have features such as straps, clasps, locks, and multiple large pockets. They are also usually waterproofed and look to serve a weather-ready purpose with their styled functionality. As such, Gore-Tex is a common inclusion.

Taisho Roman," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Nose Railway Retro Taisho Roman Train, 		 	, ,Taisho Roman was greatly influenced by western fashion that spread to Japan after it opened to trade. The word ,haikara, describes this popularization of Western styles. Western business suits and bowler hats became popular with men in Japan. The western-style ,sailor suit, became the school uniform for girls as ,serafuku,. Synthetic fibers and dyes began to be manufactured more widely in Japan, and a wider array of clothes than ever before began to emerge in in new styles and colors. 
,While high-class women were able to embrace the Western ,flapper, fashions completely, creating a style known as ,moga, ('modern girl'), lower-class women incorporated the iconic styles of the era (such as shawls, cloche hats, etc) into styling. Geometric motifs on kimonos were also commonly seen. 
,The male equivalent to moga is known as ,mobo, ('modern boy'). It featured bowler hats and sunglasses with the lenses removed. These glasses were called ,Lloyd glasses, because they were popularized by the 1920s comedian Harold Lloyd.

Tacticool,"In line with it's military roots, Tacticool fashion is equally centered around military gear, but it's influence is more on what is worn by special forces units than ""regular"" military. This includes tight-fitting combat shirts and pants, baggy hardshell jackets, plate carrier vests, or low-cut combat shoes.
,While Tacticool has been rooted in the military aesthetic, recent trends have shown the Tacticool aesthetic being injected with more paramilitary influences. Key elements to this includes the mixing of ordinary ""civilian"" clothing, most prominently jeans and flannel or plaid shirts; general reduction in camouflage wear or utilizing ""vintage"" camouflage patterns; and usage of non-military issue tactical paraphernalia such as tactical hoodies.
,Overseas, prominent variations of the tacticool aesthetic are that of the battle maid and armed schoolgirl, which essentially overlays tactical gear such as vests and kneepads over their respective uniforms. Though, in the latter case it is often with the Japanese style of uniforms.

Despite this, a lot of the people who participate in Swenka are not actually rich business men, but rather working-class citizens making ends meet. As a result, a lot of the suits seen are not too expensive, which are usually around the $100-$200 range. Swenkas also participate in fashion shows, where contestants can win a small prize of money.

Accessories are also important to steampunk; popular ones include brass/copper jewelry, pocket watches, and goggles. One of the defining features of steampunk is its use of technology and machinery. Steampunk jewelry often incorporates gears, cogs, and other mechanical elements that are inspired by the technology of the Victorian era. These elements are often used as decorative accents on jewelry pieces, and can give the jewelry a unique and industrial look,[1],. Popular motifs include cogs, clocks, and sea creatures (particularly ,octopodes,). Steampunk is popular in cosplay, but it can also be expressed more casually.,[2],[3],

Spy Fiction,"Much of the clothing associated with Spy Fiction is inspired by spy movies from the 1960s, when characters wore black turtlenecks and tan trench coats.

,Disguises,[,],Spies often desire to blend in with their surroundings as opposed to standing out. Most spy stories involve ""The Spy"" infiltrating a fancy event (e.g. ball) and therefore most spies will have a specific disguise for events like this.

Spanish Golden Age,"Spanish Golden Age Fashion, was characterized by its opulence and luxurious style, matching the wealth and power of the Spanish nobility of the time. The use of expensive fabrics like silk, velvet, and satin was common, as well as intricate embroidery, lace, and jewels. Generally, a person's fashion choice often could ""read into"" one's social and laboral status through elaborate clothing and accessories. Religious motifs were also common in the clothing, due to its important influence. Motifs such as rosaries, crosses and images of saints were commonly found, especially in women's dresses, because modesty and purity were seen as fundamental feminine traits. Along with this, Gender roles were a fundamental value of the society, so men wore loose-fitting garments with intricate details, while women wore more restrictive clothing that traditionally represented modesty. Another important key feature of the fashion worn during the Spanish Golden Age were the regional and historical influences. Since Spain was a recently unified country at the time, pretty all the regions had pretty distinct cultural backgrounds (for example; the Castilians, Aragonese, Granadians/Andalusians, Catalans, Basques, Navarrans, Galicians, Asturians, Leonese, Valencians, etc. - All of these regions had their differences due to the fact they were distinct kingdoms before unification), and this obviously contributed to the sense of fashion in Spain during the 16th and 17th century. The north of Spain was stereotypically considered to be more modest, conservative, religious and 'cultured', while the south of Spain was considered romantic and warm. Southern fashion also included north African and Andalusi influences such as Moorish-inspired patterns and colours, reflecting the long standing Muslim heritage of the south. ,

Shamate,"Much like the iconic shamate hair, shamate fashion is designed to be eye-catching and help them stand out, which had made them generally hated by Chinese society as a whole (not helped by the fact that many shamate tended to be lower-class workers, and the irony of the fact that shamate help to keep the Chinese economy going isn't lost on the shamate devotees).  As the backlash against the shamate from mainstream society increased, the shamate went even further underground, but it still pops up in other places in China from time to time.  Despite the mainstream backlash against shamate, shamate devotees don't necessarily have the same level of disdain for mainstream culture as a whole.  Clothing-wise, a lot of shamate will rock anything ranging from ,fake luxury, clothing brands to fashion influenced by ,Korean, fashion to Western-style ,Punk,, ,Scene,, and ,Emo, fashion.

Romanticism,"Nineteenth century Romantics generally wore their hair longer than the squares of the day, and would have probably worn more typically androgynous clothing. Their wardrobe consisted of silk scarves, looser jackets and pantaloons, straw hats, and a walking stick—seeing as the Romantic loves to hike and walk through nature. 
,However, the Romantic ideal of the young genius resulted in a trend towards looking sickly. Romantics often wanted to look consumptive—that is to say flushed and thin—and worshipped the premature deaths of Romantic poet John Keats (who died at the age of 25) and composer Frederic Chopin (who was 39), both of tuberculosis.

Rollerwave,"Rollerwave fashion is reflective of the popular fashions of the 1970s, but only the mundane, everyday fashions- the sort of thing one would find in a Montgomery Ward or Woolworth's, or Gary Collins's closet. Sideburns are common, as are sports jackets and knee-high skirts. Above all else, Rollerwave fashion is not at all provocative or challenging to the mainstream.

Rockabilly,"Clothing,[,],Rockabilly fashion is one of the most interesting because it works with bold, rich colors and old-school style. Although it's not that common to see women wearing this style in the streets nowadays, the Rockabilly genre and its style is making a small comeback thanks to the ever-changing music scene and the growing trend of modernized 50's and 60's fashion. 
,There are many options when it comes to choosing tops for the outfit, from tank tops to crop tops to high-tie button-down blouses and more. Stripes and polka dots are the preferred patterns, along with solid colors. Red, white, and black are the base colors to choose. Pencil skirts and cuffed denim pants are very common lower wear.
,Polka dot dresses are a staple in Rockabilly fashion and they are given a lot of importance. They're always loud and eye-catching, even if they're not brightly colored. Most Rockabilly dresses are form fitting, hitting just below the knee, but there are always variations, many being ruffled and slightly voluminous. 
,There are many styles of shoes with heels, a height of 7.5-10cm being the most common. Alternatively, there's also ballet flats, saddle shoes, converse, and creepers.
,Hair & Makeup,[,], 	 , 	, 	, 		,	, ,  	 	, 		 			, 		 		 			,How to do a Rockabilly Make Up Style Tutorial, 		 		 	, ,Black seems to be the hair color of choice when it comes to Rockabilly style and most common. Since most people aren't born with natural jet-black hair, it's usually dyed. One thing to keep in mind is that most hairstyles for women have curled parts, are pinned up, and often include hair accessories like flowers or small bows. 
,Various deep shades of red are used for the lips, along with winged eyeliner and mascara. Blush is applied to the apple of the cheeks to give a rosy hue and sometimes fake beauty marks are added.

Raygun Gothic,"Raygun Gothic fashion tends to draw heavy inspiration from how people in the mid-20th century viewed how the future was going to look. Hence, fashion draws inspiration from existing mid-century fashion and outfits seen in pulp sci-fi of the time. Atompunk fashion such as skirts, boots, and gloves, usually made of a smooth synthetic material such as latex, are typical for women, as are skintight spacesuits invoking the covers of pulp sci-fi comic books (which did tend to be rather sexually suggestive from time to time). More modern iterations of Raygun Gothic tend to emphasize the risqué nature of the fashion. The Raygun Gothic aesthetic also extends to t-shirts, hats, etc. adorned with graphics like starbursts, rockets, atom models, and minimalistic depictions of planets, stars, and galaxies.

One such example of this in action is a Thermochromatic pigment that leads to a ""Mood Ring"" effect; while it's typically reserved for the titular fashion accessory, some people can utilize the crystals used to make the ""mood ring"" effect and apply it to shoes and other clothing items to create a truly unique look (and one YouTube channel, DipYourCar, has even taken this a step further and applied this to a car). If one doesn't want to buy pre-made items, it is possible to find the pigments online and use them on DIY fashion projects as a form of dye.

Queencore,"Fashion may be taken directly from historical accounts or may be modernized. Real life examples can include historical figures like Queen Victoria for a more historical approach, or figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle for more modern fashion. Fictional examples can include Queen Calanthe from ,The Witcher,, Cersei Lannister from ,Game of Thrones,, Mary, Queen of Scots from ,Reign,, and The Countess from ,American Horror Story, (for a more creative twist). Staples include intricate embroidery, beading, jewel and metal embellishments, darker or richer colors, and long sleeves. Suggestions include:

,Makeup,[,],Queencore makeup typically embodies a regal and ethereal aesthetic. Here are some elements commonly associated with queencore makeup:
,Flawless complexion: Start with a smooth and even base by using a foundation that matches your skin tone. Apply concealer to hide any blemishes or dark circles and set it with a light dusting of translucent powder for a matte finish.,
,Soft, radiant glow: Achieve a luminous complexion by applying a subtle highlighter on the high points of your face, such as the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, and cupid's bow.,
,Rosy or peachy blush: Use a blush in soft, romantic shades of pink or peach to give your cheeks a natural flush. Apply it lightly for a delicate, youthful look.,
,Defined eyebrows: Shape and define your eyebrows using an eyebrow pencil or powder to create an arch that complements your face shape. Fill in any sparse areas for a polished appearance.,
,Neutral or soft-toned eyeshadow: Opt for neutral or pastel shades like champagne, rose gold, or soft mauve to create a dreamy eye look. Blend the eyeshadow across the eyelids, focusing on the crease to add depth and dimension.,
,Winged eyeliner or soft smoky eye: Create a winged eyeliner look with a precise liquid or gel liner for a defined and elegant effect. Alternatively, you can go for a soft smoky eye by using muted shades and blending them for a subtle, ethereal effect.,
,Long, fluttery lashes: Apply several coats of lengthening and volumizing mascara to give your lashes a dramatic, fluttery appearance. You can also add false lashes for extra intensity.,
,Soft, natural lips: Choose lip colors that enhance your natural lip tone, such as nude shades, soft pinks, or peachy tones. Opt for a satin or glossy finish to keep the lips looking plump and hydrated.,
,Gemstone or pearl accents: For a touch of whimsy and regality, you can add small gemstones or pearls as accents to your makeup. Place them strategically around your eyes or on the temples for a magical, queencore touch.,Hair,[,],Long, flowing locks: Long hair is often preferred in queencore hairstyles, as it adds to the ethereal and whimsical aesthetic. If you don't have long hair, you can use hair extensions to achieve the desired length.,
,Soft waves or loose curls: Gentle waves or loose curls can enhance the romantic and dreamy vibe of queencore hair. You can achieve this by using a curling iron or hot rollers, or opt for heatless methods like braiding damp hair overnight.,
,Braids and intricate updos: Braided hairstyles, such as fishtail braids, crown braids, or milkmaid braids, are often incorporated into queencore looks. They add a touch of elegance and can be embellished with flowers or delicate hair accessories. Intricate updos with twists, knots, and braids can also create a regal and enchanting effect.,
,Delicate hair accessories: Hair accessories play a significant role in queencore hairstyles. Consider adorning your hair with delicate flower crowns, bejeweled headbands, tiaras, or barrettes with pearls and rhinestones. These accessories add a whimsical and royal touch to your overall look.,
,Soft, face-framing tendrils: To create a soft and romantic frame for your face, leave a few strands of hair loose around the front. These gentle tendrils can be curled or styled to add an extra touch of femininity.,
,Pastel or vibrant hair colors: Queencore embraces a range of hair colors, from soft pastels like pink, lavender, or silver to vibrant jewel tones like deep red or emerald green. Experiment with temporary hair color or extensions if you want to try out different shades.,
,Shiny and healthy hair: Regardless of the specific style, queencore hair tends to be well-maintained, shiny, and healthy-looking. Regular deep conditioning treatments and using hair serums or oils can help achieve this radiant and lustrous effect.,Music,[,]","Baddie,Hime Lolita,Kingcore,Knightcore,Princesscore,Princecore,Royalcore","Dark Reds, Deep Purples, Royal Blue, Emerald Green, Gold, Silver, Black and White",

Punk,"Punk fashion is typically very different from what is seen on other subcultures. Clothing, hairstyles, cosmetics/jewelry, and even body modifications have their own style unique to punk. Punk fashion draws inspiration from other subcultures such as skinheads, greasers, and glam rock, and has influenced many other aesthetics, such as Grunge and Indie Rock. While a lot of punk fashion featured tartan plaid pants, band shirts, leather jackets, Mohawks, and multi-colored hair, but the key element of Punk was the anti-consumerist ideology (something that the ,Grunge, aesthetic inherited from them in the 90s) of wearing clothes either bought at thrift stores or handed down from older family members and modifying it.
,Mohawks, spiked hair, or shaved hair is popular within punk, alongside bright colours. Combat boots and high-top sneakers are popular choices of footwear, and Lace Code was at one point popular, but is now mostly unused. Leather and denim jackets and vests are common to see, and are often inundated with political messages, patches and band logos.
,Lace Code,[,],Although largely defunct now, beginning in the 1980s in Southern California, Lace code had begun to be used by the punk community to describe people's views on race, and soon other political and social ideologies. Laces were tied in a lace-ladder pattern, and the lace's colors on combat boots and Doc Martens were used to express social/political ideologies within the punk community. Their meanings:
,Black: No affiliation, or Straight Edge (see below).,
,Blue: Anti-cop/Anti-police. In some circles, it signifies that the wearer has murdered a police officer.,
,Yellow: Anti-racism and discrimination.,
,Purple: A new variant, meaning support for the LGBTQIA+ community.,
,Red: Neo-Nazi / National Front. Alternatively, could mean they have killed someone.,
,White: White Pride / KKK affiliation. Separate from Neo-Nazis.,Music,[,]","Music,2 Tone,Belgian New Beat,Deathrock,Emo,Euskal Punk,Goth,Post-Punk,Fashion/Aesthetics,Anarchowave,Atompunk,Biopunk,Cyberpunk,Decopunk,Afropunk,Dieselpunk,Greaser,Goth,Goth Punk,Graffiti Pop,Grunge,Hippie,Lowbrow,Movida Madrileña,Nanopunk,Pastel Punk,Skater,Steampunk,Stonepunk,Vintage,Politics,Pokemón","Black with bright contrasting colours like red, green, yellow",

Pretty Preppy,"When it comes to this aesthetic the clothes are meant to symbolize wealth, femininity and power. The purpose here is to make everyone think ""Wow, that girl could ruin lives while wearing heels higher than my pay grade!"". It typically consists of plaid skirts, matching blazers, white shirts under sweaters or dresses with the collar sticking out and knee socks. Mary Jane and Oxford shoes are also seen a lot, and while hairstyles are varied, accessories are everywhere and headbands are a must. Even though sometimes people think that in order to follow the aesthetic you need to be rich or have lots of money, it is possible to be inspired by it on a budget and replicate (or create your own) looks without spending a lot.
,Visuals,[,],The visuals for Pretty Preppy are heavily influenced by fashion and clothing is the primary motif of this aesthetic. The overall look of this aesthetic is similar to ,High School Dream, but with a ,Bubblegum Bitch,/,Baddie, twist.

Preppy,"For men, Preppy fashion has its roots in the Ivy League style of dress, which started around 1912 and became more established in the late 1950s. J. Press represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of Ivy League schools. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and Brooks Brothers both had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical Preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as polo, sailing, hunting, fencing, crew rowing, lacrosse, golf, tennis, rugby, squash and swimming. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in Preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as Lacoste, Daniel Cremieux, Izod, and Dooney & Bourke became associated with Preppy style in many areas of the US and Canada.
,For women, Preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as Perry Ellis and Lilly Pulitzer, influenced by designers such as Oleg Cassini, and popularized by female students at the Seven Sisters Colleges, sister institutions to the Ivy League. These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical Preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.
,Though traditional interest in Preppy style fell in the 1990s, some of the newer outfitters such as Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Vineyard Vines, Gant, and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as Marc Jacobs and Luella Bartley adding the Preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s. The Preppy aesthetic fell out of popularity when the Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 made signifiers of wealth unpopular.
,Those who follow the Preppy aesthetic pride themselves on how timeless it is. In reality, the Preppy aesthetic goes in and out of fashion. Previously strict followers of the Prep aesthetic such as cousins Audrey Kelleher, Charles McBryde, and Jenna Sweeney, have moved towards a more ,Bohemian, aesthetic.

The most important element of post-apocalyptic fashion is protection from elements, especially if battle or inclimate weather is abundant.

Pixiecore,"Pixiecore fashion is all about comfort. Typically, legs aren't exposed fully and are covered with either leggings, harem trousers, jeans or knee-length shorts. Tops include tunics and t-shirts, and sometimes knee-length or above dresses (though they always have leggings underneath). Shoes are generally flat and comfortable, such as Crocs, trainers, slip-on-shoes and Ugg-style boots. A lot of pixiecore fashion is thrifted as this is more sustainable. 
,Patterns are a big part of Pixiecore, and most outfits consist with clashing patterns and lots of colour. This can include mixing and matching florals, pairing colourful shoes with tie-dye shirts or even wearing floral trousers with a floral shirt. Sometimes, this can create the appearance of pajama fashion.

,Fashion in the Old Money aesthetic usually includes tailored suits, classic dresses, polo shirts, and loafers. Neutral and earth tones, as well as darker, rich colors, are commonly seen. The aim is to look effortlessly elegant and comfortable in your clothing, favoring well-made garments that will stand the test of time. Accessories play a key role too, with a preference for classic, timeless pieces like pearl necklaces, leather handbags, and luxury watches.
,Today, achieving the Old Money look doesn't necessarily require an ancestral mansion or a luxury yacht. This aesthetic is more accessible than ever thanks to online shopping. A comprehensive collection of Old Money style clothing is readily available online. You can explore the variety of pieces at ,old money shop,. From tailored suits and classic dresses to timeless accessories, you'll find all the essentials for your Old Money wardrobe.

The ""normcore"" trend has been interpreted as a reaction to fashion oversaturation, resulting from ever faster-changing fashion trends.
,Normcore clothes include everyday items of casual wear, such as plain T-shirts, sport jackets, baseball caps, straight jeans, chinos and sneakers, are typical apparel, but not items such as neckties or blouses. These clothes are worn by men and women alike, making normcore a unisex style.
,Clothes that meet the ""normcore"" description are mainly sold by large fashion and retail chains such as The Gap, Uniqlo, Jack & Jones, Superdry, Jigsaw, Kirkland, and Esprit. They are generally cheaply produced in East Asian countries. Many other retailers, such as Marc O'Polo, Woolrich, Desigual, Closed and Scotch & Soda produce normcore-like clothes, combined with individual design ideas.
,An example of this aethetic is the wardrobe on ""Seinfeld"", or, more recently, ""The Middle"".

Nerd,"Nerds don't have a specific style that is always followed, although anything which aligns with typically nerdy interests will make the look instantly nerdier. Any math, physics, science or nerdy interest-based clothing seems nerdy, even without the stereotypical glasses. Although being a nerd doesn't tend to have a specific look, they generally won't look trendy or extremely fashionable, unless nerdy fashion has come into the mainstream for a bit.
,The general look is usually seem as a shirt and tie or nerdy T-shirt and jeans, but there really isn't any specific guidelines to follow to look nerdy. However, nerds are rarely seen without wearing their glasses. 
,Another direction one could apply to the Nerd aesthetic in terms of fashion is partaking in the art of cosplay, or the act of putting effort into dressing up as a character from any form of media. While this is primarily done for conventions of some sort, there are some who will take photos of themselves in cosplay and post them on the internet (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr in particular are popular platforms for this sort of thing).

Neo-Tribal,"Tattoos,[,],The Neo-Tribal aesthetic particularly flourishes in the tattoo industry,[2],. The term ""Neo-Tribal"" was originally coined by western tattoo artists to incorporate influence from Māori tribal tattoos without making their artworks sound ""culturally appropiating"". Neo-Tribal tattoos are usually black and have sharp black lines and dots. This tattoo tecnique has also evolved into a more recent tecnique called "",Cybersigilism,"", as some Neo-Tribal tattoos often incorporate more influence from sigil symbology. Particularly Cybersigilism incorporates even more influence from the ,Y2K, era or even ,Cyberpunk,, including elements like black angles, thin lines and black ink,[3],. Tramp stamps are often made in the Cybersigilist style as well, including Succubus symbols, hearts, butterfly wings, etc. , ,
This style is also often incorporated into shirts and hoodies as prints.

Also, Kogal outfits can include modifications of a real school uniform, while Nanchatte Seifuku has to be pretend (otherwise it's just seifuku).

,Classic Mizuiro (2010s),[,],This fashion style mainly consists a blue color scheme, usually with hints of sportiness or techwear influences like tracksuits, hoodies, etc. Sometimes flared leg warmers are included.

,Jersey Maid (2020s),[,],Written as ジャージメイド in Japanese, the jersey maid style is a fashion style that utilizes tracksuits (commonly called jerseys in Japan) with ,maid,-like details, such as ruffles and lace. Outfits consisting of an oversized tracksuit worn in combination with a maid headdress and apron are the most common, but there's also many clothes specifically made with the style in mind that can often resemble ,Girly, and ,Lolita, fashion. Western fans had mistakenly referred to this 2020s revival of Mizuiro as Tenshi Kaiwai (天使界隈, Angel Community); this is actually the community hashtag of the Tenshi Zyoshi magazine/blog that featured the aesthetic, not the aesthetic itself.

Midwest Emo," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,The band The Promise Ring in Midwest Emo attire, 		 	, ,Historically, midwest emo style has functioned similarly to norm-core fashion in that comfortable, conservative styles of dress are more common than outright experimentation. Midwest style is unfashionable and inoffensive by design.   
,Blue jeans and chinos are the most common bottoms within this style. Touring musicians will often wear khaki shorts or even basketball shorts to maximize comfort while traveling and performing. Plaid and tartan design shirts are Midwest emo essentials, and will typically be on flannel or madras cloth. These can be worn unbuttoned revealing a plain t-shirt or graphic tee, or buttoned, though rarely will they be tucked. Polo shirts in plain colors or patterns are often worn, and plain t-shirts essential, and are actually more likely to be tucked than button-down shirts. Hoodies and sweaters are especially common in the literal Midwest.   
,The most common accessories include headwear such as dad hats, beanies, and baseball caps. Glasses, if prescribed, are typically worn rather than contact lenses.   
,Sneakers and casual boots are the most common footwear options for this style. Converse, Vans, and New Balance sneakers in white or black are most often seen, though checkered vans and athletic shoes are not uncommon. Low-top and high-top variants are equally acceptable, and pants will often be cuffed.

,Scale-patterned leggings, occasionally with a flared leg to mimic a tail,
,Tops made out of conch shells or to look like conch shells,
,Headdresses with shells, pearls, and/or crystals,Mermaid makeup was popular for festival or costume makeup, a technique using fishnet tights was developed by makeup artists that involved using the tights as a stencil to powder iridescent blue or green onto the side of the face.

Metal,"fashion tends to be really simple; t-shirts in support of their favorite band (or bands), simple jeans, boots or sneakers, and possibly a leather jacket. Both male and female metalheads have a tendency to also keep their hair long with male metalheads growing massive facial hair (and, if they don't keep their hair long, they'll shave it all off). In modern days, it's not unusual for metalheads to be covered in piercings and tattoos as well (some will also dye their hair unnatural colors), but the core Metalhead fashion remains.
,When you get into the Black Metal end of the Metalhead spectrum, they'll take the aesthetic to a brand new level; often appearing dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands and inverted crosses and inverted pentagrams to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance. However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint—black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.
,Another key factor of Metalhead culture is the art of crafting a ""battle jacket"" (sometimes referred to as a ""cut-off"" if the sleeves have been removed. Some may choose to leave the sleeves on, but this is not common). This involves buying a denim/leather jacket (though other articles of clothing have been known to be decorated in this fashion) and covering it in various patches of different band logos, albums, and motifs. Some Metalheads will make an effort to buy their patches directly from the bands, whether that be at a concert merch table or at an officially licensed online shop to support the bands. Alternatively, some may choose to hand paint or sew their patches, or just buy them from random retailers. These choices are entirely dependent on the person.

Metalcore,"For the majority, Metalcore fashion choices come from casual wear such as skinny denim pants, band T-shirts, and skater shoes. Band shirts have various art styles; the early metalcore bands had artwork influenced by New York Hardcore, Youth Crew, urban street, and dark crusty styles. The mid-2010s brought a big change to Metalcore fashion, with many bands incorporating t-shirt designs with minimalistic imagery, often inspired by streetwear fashion, alongside iconic band logos.

Melodycore,"Melodycore takes from ,girly kei, and ryosangata (mainstream trendy) fashion, sometimes incorporating lolita dresses. Clothing is feminine and cute, usually accented with ribbons, bows, lace, and frills. Oversized hoodies, t-shirts, dresses, and skirts are paired with white stockings and my melody merchandise, though this rule is not solid. Shoes are usually platform boots, Mary-Janes or loafers.
,Makeup is usually natural and nude, taking inspiration from Japanese TikTok trends (glossy lips, ""pien"" eyes, etc). Nails can be heavily decorated with girly imagery, and hairstyles can be decorated with bows, hairclips, etc.

Band-Aids with Sanrio or other cutesy patterns are extremely popular.

What many consider to be the modern-day ,preppy, ,fashion, can find its roots around this era via companies like ,Abercrombie, and ,Fitch/Hollister, American Eagle, Old Navy, Aeropostale,, or ,Pink, (this isn't to be confused with the traditional ,Preppy, aesthetic, whose aesthetic traditions are carried on via the ,Academia, aesthetic family).

Lo-Fi,"Fashion-wise, Lo-Fi's pretty forgiving and flexible; as long as it looks good in a VHS or Polaroid-style filter, you can pretty much wear anything and look good without having to break the bank: Vaporwave, Mallgoth, Hip-Hop, VSCO, Preppy, Indie, E-Girl/E-Boy, Softgirl/Softboy, Kawaii, Synthwave, Thriftcore, Hippie, Normcore, you name it and chances are it'll look good with a Lo-Fi filter placed over it.  The most common version of Lo-Fi fashion, however, involves vintage-styled clothes with a washed-out/dull appearance or upcycling/thrifting old pieces into something new to aid in this Lo-Fi style.

La Sape,"La Sape fashion is diverse and experiments with a lot of styles. La Sape takes heavily from the Roaring Twenties culture of the 1920s, its origin decade, which correlates with a desire to be elegant and rich. Clothes are often obtained or sold secondhand from more first-world countries, notably France. Brands range from Weston, Kenzo, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, and more. Another important aspect of sapeur fashion is color combination. Clothes have to stand out, so sapeurs mix, match and combine different parts of their outfits to obtain a unique look. Said clothes are expensive however, therefore sapeurs save up a lot of money to get these outfits. Sapeurs tend to own multiple outfits rather than a singular outfit.  
,In recent years, females have begun to adopt the style as well. Sapeuses use the style to rebel against the status quo of being considered second-class citizens, where they dress the same as men.

Light Academia,"Light Academia is a style inspired by the love for knowledge, art, and literature. This aesthetic, encapsulating the ideal of a student immersed in their studies, focuses on the appreciation of self-expression through intellectual pursuit. It echoes the architectural beauty of classic university campuses, the romanticism of consuming literature in a sunlit library, and the allure of lively intellectual discussions.
,Fashion-wise, Light Academia leans towards a blend of comfortable and sophisticated, a collegiate style with a refined twist. Key elements include neutral and earth tones, chunky knit sweaters, tailored trousers, vintage glasses, and a good pair of Oxford shoes. Think of a modern reinterpretation of an Oxford student strolling through the campus in the early spring, book in hand.

Larme Kei," 	 , 	, 	, 		,	, ,  	 	, 		 			, 		 		 			,""Sweet Girly"" as known from LARME, 		 		 	, ,As described above, this section describes the ""rules"" of the fashion perceived by the Western community. These bloggers translated the taglines of the models (which only went on for a handful of editions), and interpreted it as ""substyles"" on the true Larme Kei look. This concept was later left behind, but because of the lag due to translation, misinterpretation, etc., it was seen as a constant in the magazine. 
,The ""substyles"" featured in the magazine will be in the subsections below. 
,Pheromone Fetish,[,],This style was worn by Risa Nakamura, and was characterized by being more overtly sexy in comparison to the other girls. ,Fur coats,, especially in ,leopard print,, is a common motif in her outfits and fits the sensual, texture-heavy motifs of the styling. Likewise, ,fetish and lingerie fabrics, like leather, lace, mesh, and shiny black fabrics can appear.
,The ,silhouette is also tighter,. Pencil skirts, baby tees, and turtlenecks are more popular in her outfits. 
,American & French Lolita,[,],The earliest issues of Larme magazine had a high focus on ""Lolita fashion"", much to the annoyance of Japanese ,Lolita fashion, enthusiasts.,[5], In the case of Larme, the term Lolita is used as name for ,nymphet fashion, with ""American Lolita"" being inspired by the 1997 movie and ""French Lolita"" by the works of Serge Gainsbourg.,[6], Thus, the fashion spreads the editors made were in the style of the different film adaptations. ,Red, especially gingham,, was a common motif.

Laborwave,"Laborwave fashion may take some style cues from Vaporwave, but since so little actual Laborwave fashion exists, Laborwave fashion borrows heavily from Communist Chic, based in famous communist iconography. Expect a lot of Laborwavers to wear shirts with Che Guevara, the hammer-and-sickle, and other examples of communist iconography, but outside of that, they're generally not the type to indulge in fashion whatsoever, since they don't typical indulge in things like that.

Labcore,"Labcore fashion mostly uses bright colors, inspired by the 80s. Particular combinations include purple and green, and to a lesser extent, orange and teal. Fashion usually features the signature lab coat and black turtleneck combination that most mad scientist characters wear, although can differ from person to person. Accessories include plain hair bands, drawn accessories such as stitches drawn with a marker or other writing tool.
,This style also mixes aesthetics of academia with 80s aesthetics. Think study papers only illuminated by a neon light. This style is particularly combined with motifs of homoeroticism and mental illness.

Korean Cozy Beige,"Clothes,[,],The fashion of Korean Cozy Beige is usually built around casual, comfortable clothing. Some examples of this are:
,Cardigans,
,Sweatshirts,
,Solid colours,
,Cute character graphics,
,Round glasses,
,Sneakers,
,Tote bags,
,Oversized coats,Hair, makeup and accessories,[,],Hair might be worn in a messy bun or ponytail with a scrunchie, or as bedhead or casually down and tousled. The makeup associated with Korean Cozy Beige is a natural look, very minimal makeup usually focusing on the eyes with some eyeliner and aegyo sal. For lips either go with an ombre look making the centre of your lips darker, or a pale tone with gloss. Nails, if painted, are done in cute simple styles such as popular characters or soft neutral colours. Accessories are minimal, usually small dainty pieces like necklaces, rings and a watch on the wrist.

Kogal,"The style of Kogals is based around Japanese high school uniforms. Any type of school uniform is fine, although most uniforms tend to have plaid skirts, bows around the neck and sweaters. They are often beige in color. serafuku  (sailor uniforms) are also very popular. 
,Whilst most Kogals wear their actual uniforms, they also popularised the use of ',Nanchatte Seifuku,' (fake school uniforms).  
,Kogals add a twist to their uniform, in order to make it appear sexier and cuter. They shorten their skirts, wear legwarmers or loose socks and sometimes even add bows or ties to their uniform, even when they aren't apart of their uniform.
,Some Kogals also buy extra uniforms from different schools and wear them after school, and although it is rarer, older kogals who are out of school buy uniforms to wear.
,The style is also characterized by dyed hair, and with older girls, tanned skin. Tanned skin has become less common in kogal, however, as tanning itself has become less popular among gyarus.
,Kogals often dyed their hair blondes, reds and light shades of browns, although sometimes colours such as pink and blues could be added.

Kinderwhore,"Kinderwhore fashion was designed to take the most ""feminine"" aspects of gender roles, inflate them to a cartoonish level, and subvert it all into the rawest, angriest, most badass way possible, where they were not afraid to get as aggressive and confident on stage as their counterparts in the mostly male dominated ,Grunge, scene.  Some elements of Kinderwhore fashion include:
,peter pan collars,
,babydoll dresses,
,slip dresses,
,mary jane shoes,
,combat boots,
,platform shoes,
,ripped tights,
,messy makeup,

,faux fur coats,
,leather jackets,
,kneesocks,
,lace socks,
,heels,
,chokers, chains, etc,Kinderwhore clothing can most easily be found in charity or thrift shops, or can be DIYed. Kinderwhore is a style within grunge, so the goal is to not look neat and tidy, damaged clothing is better to use for this specific look.
,The kinderwhore fashion has resurged in recent years due to social media sites like TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest, with creators like Lipst1ckteeth.
,Fairy grunge is a similar style where the wearer doesn't seem as interested in subverting gender norms, but instead just appreciates the aesthetic appeal of the contrast that Kinderwhore set out to accomplish. Fairy grunge is used to make oneself look more appealing in a way that clashes with Kinderwhore's philosophy, and therefore cannot be called Kinderwhore.

Jersey Shore,"Jersey Shore fashion is typical of what you'd see on MTV's ,Jersey Shore,: lots of Ed Hardy and Affliction, rosaries (hilarious given how debaucherous and Hedonistic they can be), bling often associated with the high roller lifestyle, and expensive Italian brands.  The Jersey Shore aesthetic is largely centered around ""fake it 'til you make it"" and the Jersey Shore woman's fashion could cross over into ,Baddie, territory (and could be seen as the launching point for the Baddie fashion style as a whole) but also shares with the general rule of thumb for their male counterparts.  You can also expect a lot of skintight t-shirts and tanktops adorned with the Italian flag in a show of Italian pride (although, ironically, most individuals who adhere to the Jersey Shore aesthetic aren't even full-blooded or even remotely Italian; it doesn't matter how much you fake it, that is one goal that you will never make because you cannot change your ethnicity).
,One of the most noteworthy (and constantly meme'd) hairstyles of the Jersey Shore aesthetic is the ""blow-out"" (famously worn by DJ Pauly D of ,Jersey Shore, fame) where they spend hours combing and gelling their hair until it looks like something out of an anime (Dragon Ball Z is a popular comparison).  Otherwise, the hairstyles tend to be buzzed and styled in a very short way.  Jersey Shore women have a tendency to really cake on the make-up and wear hair extensions, although another popular hairstyle among the Women is the ""poof"" (popularized by Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi) where they style their hair in a way that could give the illusion of being taller than they really are.  One thing the people on the Jersey Shore loooooooove to do is tan.  They will burn their skin to a crisp or use bucketloads of fake tanner to give the appearance of constantly being out and about on the go, despite the fact they usually spend their time indoors either tanning, working out, styling their hair, caking on make-up, going to the laundromat to have their clothes dropped of for the next day, or going out to the clubs to pick up women.  As mentioned previously, there are a lot of Jersey Shore people who spend a lot of time in the gym and, as a result, anabolic steroid and HGH usage is very popular among the men to enhance their muscular appearance.

Jirai Kei," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,The various styles worn by jirai girls illustrated featuring Blue Archive characters., 		 	, ,The styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to ,E-Girl,'s style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from ,Japanese Girly fashion, and ,Yami Kawaii,, however outfits consisting out of ,Goth Punk,, ,Jersey Maid,, and darker general ,alternative, fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimick one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends.  
,Regardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura.  
,Tops,[,],The most common tops are ,blouses with ultra-feminine details, that may slightly resemble ,Lolita Fashion., Peter Pan collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often ,tie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels, at the neck.  
,Some brands have also released ,oversized tees and sweatshirts, that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the ,Yami Kawaii, aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces.    
,Bottoms,[,],High waisted mini skirts, are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. ,Silver hardware details, such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. ,Shorts, can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as ,longer flowy skirts,. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. 
,The more casual ,Jersey Maid, and ,Yami Kawaii, inspired looks can also have ,track pants, like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. 
,Shoes and Legwear,[,],Because the legs are most often exposed in this style, ,lace or fishnet stockings, are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with ,ruffled or lace ankle socks,. 
,The shoes are most commonly ,platform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes,, and most girls buy their shoes from from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be ,more decorated,, with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. 
,Accessories,[,],The most popular bags are ,totes and mini backpacks,. Usually they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushie or sanrio figurine keychains attatched. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from ,popular luxury brands,.
,Aside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver.
,Hair and Makeup,[,], 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,An illustration of the typical hairstyles by ,Akagumi-chan,., 		 	, ,Hime-cut bangs,, which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the ,most common hair color is black,, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add ,highlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink.,
,In terms of styling, ,pigtails, (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being ,half-up half-down,. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with ,ribbons and bows,, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other ,hair accessories, such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too.  
,For the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of  the "",namida bukuro,"" makeup style where the ,tear bags, are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The ,eyeliner is downturned to give a more ""puppy-like"", and feminine and sad appearance.  
,Face and lip makeup are equally pink, with ,blush and sparkly highlighter being high, on the cheekbones. ,Lip makeup has a wide variation,, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. 
,Many additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. ,Fake lashes, are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. ,Dark circle lenses, are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. 
,Long acrylic nails, are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji.

Indie,"Old school Indie fashion was pretty vague and unassuming. Many pieces were thrifted and casual, a bit more digestible and easier to assemble than ,Grunge, although very similar. It does take some influence from ,Normcore, due to how wide the spectrum of the fashion is however old school indie fashion had more characteristics that made it look less basic, the common theme is individuality so personal preference is the biggest value present. Some other common factors include darker colors and alternative tendencies.

Indie Kid,"Indie kid fashion is very similar to the fashion trends of the 2000s and sometimes older. For girls, a crop top and baggy pants is popular, with the top being some type of bold color and the pants being jeans or even cargo pants. An oversized tee, an oversized sweatshirt or a collared shirt under a sweatshirt are also options, but the baggy pants are a key feature of this aesthetic. Boys follow most of the same rules, minus the crop tops (but they are of course free to wear it if they wish). Common shoes worn by indie kids are Converse, Vans and other chunky sneakers.
,Makeup is natural, but sometimes heavy blush is worn, too. Hair is typically worn down or in two ponytails. Bangs, especially curtain bangs, are popular.
,Brands where you can find many of these things are Princess Polly, SheIn, Brandy Melville, Francesca's, American Eagle, Vans and various thrift stores.

Hipster,"Hipster Fashion revolves around the idea of rejecting the mainstream trends and using unique or quirky items to define an outfit. This can range from hairstyles and facial hair to socks. Rejecting unsustainable and uninspired mainstream fast fashion, hipsters will often shop at thrift stores or make use of vintage items. Contrasting and layering items together, especially those that may be traditionally seen as being part of different styles, is the way to create a hipster outfit. Tattoos are popular.
,Tops,[,],Flannel shirts are an archetypical symbol of lumbersexual-style hipster outfits. More urban styles may go for vintage t-shirts, especially with unique or anachronistic imagery (vinyl decals, typewriter font, etc.) V-neck t-shirts have been associated with a hipster look. Vests, sweaters, suspenders, blazers, and zip-up hoodies could all be layered with these bases.
,Bottoms,[,],Skinny jeans are the standard hipster bottoms. If standard blue jeans, these are more likely to be a darker wash, though they can also be distinct and brightly coloured. Some hipsters, especially those inclined to something of the twee aesthetic, may be fond of sundresses and flowing skirts - the hippie inspiration factors in here.
,Shoes,[,],Depending on the hipster outfit, different shoes may be an essential part. Men's patterned leather brogues, Converse-style sneakers, or leather desert boots can be worn. Unique, patterned, brightly colored, or mismatched socks can be worn with these shoes.
,Facial Hair,[,],Moustaches and full beards are considered a distinctive hipster marker.
,Accesories,[,],It could be said that a hipster outfit is truly made by trimming it with unique and quirky accessories. These might include:
,Beanies/toques (especially worn pushed back on the head in the slouchy style),
,Newsboy caps,
,Horn-rimmed glasses,
,Round sunglasses,
,Bowties,

Holosexual,"A majority of holosexual fashion is centered on make-up and nail polish, although there are examples of Holosexual clothing that exists out in the wild (and can even be bought on websites like Amazon). While most Holosexual fashion tends to skew towards more the feminine end of the gender spectrum, there are examples of male holosexual clothing out there, so the boys can have fun with this look, too. Holosexual fashion seems to be very common in ,Raver, fashion, though some male holosexual fashion seems to take a lot of notes from '70s Disco fashion.

Hip-Hop,"Hip hop fashion has changed over the years, with the style now being more of a high-end streetwear look. Due to the 90's Revival, 80's, 90's and early 2000's hip hop looks have been coming back into style (this does not mean that modern hip-hop fashion is out of style, it is just more common). 70's, 80's, 90's and early 2000's hip hop fashion usually consisted of affordable, oversized clothes (for both men and women) because 1) they were always moving and needed to be comfortable all the time and 2) youth in the Bronx didn't have much control over where they lived, so fashion gave them lots of freedom; as we moved into the 2000s women began wearing more dresses and heels. Sneakers were common, but skate shoes and high top Doc Martens have been seen as well.  
,Successful rappers put lots of emphasis on jewelry and displayed their riches through ""iced out' rings, chains, and even on their teeth (grills). In the late 90s and early 2000s hip hop fashion became popular and recognized by high-end brands, it wasn't uncommon to see rappers wearing a brand name article of clothing and a plain pair of pants, or a fashionable pair of sneakers and a run-of-the-mill tracksuit. Hip hop fashion today tends to gravitate towards higher-end brands (e.g Nike) and sportswear-type outfits commonly found on the streetwear scene. A majority of the fashion stays baggy, breathable and fashionable.

Hime Lolita,"The dresses in Hime Lolita have several layers of ruffles and other details, and jumperskirts are often worn without a blouse. This is to remove the childlike aspect, and cause the coordinate to appear more classy. If a blouse is used, it usually is a square or heart neckline with flared sleeves, made from chiffon. If one wants to go for a even more mature appearance, a corset can be used. The hemline of the dress is worn on or above the knees, but can be longer as well.
,Hime Lolita is a difficult style to pull off quite right for those are beginners in Lolita fashion, since it's difficult to coordinate all the details without messing up the look. Additionally, the quality of the material needs to be rich to attain that princess appearance.
,Hairstyles in Hime Lolita can range from casual to over the top hairdos, both usually involving curls. Wigs are often used to achieve this effect, with the three most common hairstyles being a ""traditional"" Hime haircut (bangs straight with short locks on the front, and then running longer in the back.), elegant and big teased hair, and elegantly curled hair.
,On the topic of headwear, things such as crowns and bonnets are often used. Another item that is favored would be rose headdresses. Gold, silver jewelry or pearls are common, with necklaces or rings having roses or little bows on them as an added detail. Adding ruffes and lace adds to the look a lot. Elbow-length gloves or longer are used in the winter. Paper or lace fans with pearls, roses or rhinestones decorated on them are seen in the summer. Purses are kept rather simple and can have some detailing on them. 
,Socks are knee or ankle length, and can have details such as frills, lace, small bows, or feature patterns such as cake or stripes. Transparent or lace tights an very much help to further a fancy look, however.

There are differences in makeup depending on the era, but both old and modern Gyaru styling has in common that the focus on eye-enlarging makeup. In the past, this was archived by drawing an exaggerated bottom lash line in combination with wearing multiple layers of fake lashes, but over the years it has become a lot more common to use circle lenses in combination with ""eye bag"" makeup for a similar effect.
,Hair,[,],As Gyaru is opposing traditional Japanese beauty standards, there are many people who bleach their hair to an unnatural shade of blonde, but pink and silver dyes are also popular. There is a tendency for wavy-to-curly hairstyles, with long hair being the most popular as it is easier to accessorize.

Grunge,"Grunge fashion of the late 1980s and early-mid 1990s was often purchased out of thrift stores at the time. Some will argue it was done out of a rejection of the fashions of the time. It's generally agreed that it's because it was cheaper as, at the time, most grunge artists were dirt poor. As the fashion became more mainstream, editor of men's magazine Details James Truman was quoted in 1993, ""to me the thing about grunge is it's not anti-fashion, it's unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it's crazy for it to become a fashion statement.""
,Men often wore over-sized t-shirts, flannel shirts (that would be tied off around the waist when it got too hot), ripped jeans, and combat boots. These were considered timeless looks and were generally durable and reliable clothing to wear. Women tended to favor slip dresses, flannel shirts, ripped jeans, chokers, and the bell-bottoms/babydoll t-shirt was a popular combination as well. It went out of fashion after Kurt Cobain's suicide, but has started coming back into fashion in the 2010s and 2020s as '90s nostalgia began (an argument could be made this is what has led to the rise in prominence of ,Vaporwave, as well). This trend began to regress as ,Y2K, starts to become more and more prominent only to cycle back in another 20 years, as all trends seem to. But with the modern Grunge movement, the philosophical elements of the original Grunge movement were completely dropped in favor of just achieving the visual aesthetic of looking Grunge (although often paying far more exorbitant amounts of money compared to the original Grunge style icons, who almost exclusively shopped at Thrift Stores). 
,For more feminine, edgy fashion, however, there was also the ,Kinderwhore, aesthetic, popularized by Courtney Love, who was Kurt Cobain's wife.

These hairstyles were held in place with pomade like suavecito and layrite, wax, or hair creams such as brylcreem.
,The leather jacket, as popularized by pilots during World War II, became an icon of greaser culture. Compared with the previous decades, the 1950s were considered dull and the youths craved a new sense of adventure. The leather jacket marked greaser youths as daring and adventuresome young men, like the pilot heroes of the recent war.

Gothic Lolita,"Like all ,Lolita, substyles, Gothic Lolita follows the iconic silhouette consisting of headdress, blouse, poofy skirt, petticoat, legwear, and accessories. While a ""cupcake"" shape is common for most other Lolita styles, there's also many A-line shape ones in Gothic to make the coordinate appear more sophisticated or mature.
,All kinds of hairstyles are worn in Gothic Lolita, but the most common is straight hair with hime-cut bangs, sometimes worn with half-pigtails that can also be curled. The hair is often dyed to archive yet black hair or unnatural colors.
,Makeup incorporated in Gothic Lolita often consists of pale foundation, black eyeliner, fake lashes, light blush, and dark lipstick, although the makeup is supposed to still look ""natural"" (straight up black lipstick is rarely worn).
,Accessories for Gothic Lolita consists of rectangle headdresses, lace chokers, wrist cuffs, silver jewelry, bags, and parasols, usually adorned with Gothic motifs. Legwear is usually black and consisting out of lace or printed fabric with matching lace border. Jewelry, if added, usually has gems in dark colors, and metal tones are more common than golden tones. Venice lace chokers or a rosary are also often worn as jewelry to accessorize. Wrist cuffs are also very popular in Gothic Lolita.
,Shoes commonly used in Gothic Lolita are mary janes, rocking horse shoes, and other platform shoes along with low to mid size heels. They are usually black so they match the rest of the outfit.
,The difference between Gothic Lolita and other Lolita styles in black lies in the details of the outfit even when void of the typical motifs in the form of prints. Sweet decorative elements like bows on garments get replaced by dainty satin ribbon and roses, and lace is prefered instead of ruffles.

Goth,"Gothic fashion, is a clothing style marked by conspicuously dark, mysterious, antiquated, and homogeneous features. It is mostly worn by members of the Goth subculture. A dark, sometimes ghastly fashion and style of dress, typical Gothic fashion includes an unhealthy complexion with dyed black hair, dark lipstick, and dark clothing. Both male and female goths can wear dark eyeliner and dark nail polish most especially black. Styles are often borrowed from punk fashion, Victorians, Edwardians, and Elizabethans.
,Like punks, gothic fashion is mainly about DIY and thrifting clothes (its highly encouraged, even). Secondhand-black clothes, handmade jewelry, modifications on tights and jeans, and jackets with patches are some of the more common staples of DIY'd gothic fashion. Most expensive of the common accessories are the shoes (usually combat boots or winklepickers, the latter being a joke among goths that it is THE Goth shoe). However, there do exist some Goths who prefer to shop from the vendors below.
,It’s important to remember though that not all Goths dress the same or even wear all-black. What pulls them together is their appreciation for Goth Rock, Deathrock, Darkwave, Ethereal Wave, and other key Goth music genres. 
,Since the second biggest part of Goth is the fashion, a lot of styles were influenced by the subculture's looks. As a result, a plethora of dark fashion styles exist today. They are divided between those with a genuine presence in the musical scene, and those that are just generalizations:

Goblincore,"Goblincore fashion can involve any clothing that is suitable for adventure, but most goblincore fans like outfits with several clashing patterns/colors. Lots of the clothing is worn-out, thrifted, or second-hand for a more comfortable feel. Most goblincore fans enjoy getting dirty, so keeping their clothes fresh and clean isn't a top priority. Cozy Oversized Sweaters, worn-out or customized jeans and overalls, and unique socks are staples in goblincore fashion. These people like to wander around the woods and collect random objects that pique their interest. Since they love nature so much, Earthy colored clothes like brown or green fit them the best
,Goblins are often seen in dark green or brown clothes. Sometimes, they will also have belts with alchemists pouches or a satchel to store shiny objects.

Gen Z Maximalism,"Maximalist fashion has more overlap with ,Decora, and ,Kidcore, than its graphic and interior design counterparts, but other than that it's more or less the same, with colorful, cluttered themes. However, Maximalist fashion tends to lean more towards ,Kidcore, when it comes to its choice of a primary color palette. In contrast, Maximalism seems to learn more towards clutter in clashing and contrasting saturated colors throughout the outfit, as opposed to clutter in the sheer volume of accessories often found in ,Decora,. Another stark difference between the two is Decora's primary focus on fashion, and Maximalism's primary focus on graphic and interior design. Note the overlap between the two does mean many decora outfits can also fall under the category of maximalism fashion, and vice versa. This can open up a portal to introduce fans of certain aesthetics to similar ones they may also enjoy, but please remember to only tag your posts with relevant hashtags.

Girly Girl,"Girly girl fashion refers to a style that embraces femininity, softness, and a youthful aesthetic. It often incorporates elements such as floral patterns, pastel colors, ruffles, lace, bows, and other delicate details. Girly girl fashion emphasizes a sweet and romantic look, with an emphasis on dresses, skirts, and feminine silhouettes.
,Some key characteristics of girly girl fashion include:
,Dresses and skirts: Girly girls often gravitate towards dresses and skirts as their go-to clothing choices. These pieces are typically flowy, with flared or A-line shapes, and may feature floral prints or lace accents.,
,Pastel colors: Soft, pastel hues such as pink, lavender, mint green, baby blue, and lemon yellow are commonly associated with girly girl fashion. These colors evoke a gentle and feminine vibe.,
,Frills and ruffles: Girly girl fashion embraces frills and ruffles as decorative elements. They can be found on sleeves, hemlines, or collars, adding a touch of playfulness and femininity to the outfits.,
,Cute accessories: Girly girls often accessorize their outfits with bows, ribbons, headbands, and floral hair accessories. These details enhance the overall girly and youthful look.,

Girly Kei," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 	, ,Japanese Girly Kei fashion takes some cues from general ,kawaii, and ,lolita, fashion, with some preferring it as a somewhat more casual or minimal alternative to more extreme lolita outfits. The goal is to appear cutesy and feminine, but in a preppy manner. Many of the current trends within the style are derived from Ryousangata girly trends that originated on social media (such as TikTok), and ,Japanese Idol culture, has pushed Girly Kei's evolution into a more hyper-feminine and innocent direction.
,Blouses are the most common top in Girly Kei fashion. Usually these tops are high-neck, peter-pan collared embellished with ruffles, lace, and ribbon embellishments. Sometimes pom-pom capes are added. In the wintertime, sweaters can be adorned with decorative stitching, ribbons and typical girlish embellishments. Bottoms are most commonly skirts, usually high waisted with decorated hems. Sometimes petticoats are added underneath to increase volume. Rarely, frilly shorts and skorts are worn. Bottoms can be swapped with dresses or coat-dresses of any length. Girly Kei mostly incorporates multi-strap Mary-Janes or sometimes loafers, both platformed. These are paired with lace or frilled socks or stockings. 
,Girly Kei makeup follows more mainstream Jfashion trends emphasizing a ""natural"" youthful look with soft blush, low contour and lipstick with faded edges. However, it is not uncommon for the eyes to be largened and exxagerated to give a more doe-like, teary-eyed appearance. This follows the ""pien"" makeup trend on Japanese tiktok, and occasionally even the more sickly red-eyed byojaku trend. Hairstyles are also variable, and it's seen as trendy to to curl the ends. Naturally, Girly Kei fashion makes use of jewelry, but may restrain them to traditional necklaces, bracelets and earrings with hair accesories.
,Similar to ,Lolita,, the broad nature of Girly Kei as a fashion has allowed it to develop multiple substyles, including but not limited to ,French Girly,, Dark Girly, Casual Girly, Otona (mature) Girly, Natural Girly, Sweet (kawaii) Girly, etc.  Because of its adjacency with the Dark Girly substyle, ,Jirai Kei,'s fashion part is often considered a substyle of both Dark Girly and Yami Kawaii, and similar to it, there is also many other styles such as ,Melodycore, that have been influenced by Girly fashion.

Folk Punk,"Folk punk fashion is closely related to the fashion of ,crusties,, with many folk punks wearing battle jackets with patches and pins and looking like typical punks. Another common folk punk fashion choice is farmer clothes that have a dirty, plain and a crusty look for them, that are usually colored very muted colours like light brown or gray. Accompanying this farmer look is usually very minimal makeup or scraggly looking facial hair.  Flatcaps, baseball caps and trucker caps are common headwear for folk punks as well, with many choosing to customise them with pins and patches. Beanies are also a common headwear for folk punks. Some folk punk artists also dress in normal everyday clothing.

Flat Design,"Cyber minimalist fashion often overlaps with ,minimalist, fashion with its smooth fabrics and limited colors, however cyber minimalism has less excess material and fits closer to the body. It is not tight to the body, but it has less bagginess than some minimalist fashion. It tends to not have patterned or textured fabric, but it is acceptable in moderation. There are few accessories as well, usually gold, silver, or black, fitting in with the minimalist fashion.

,Vintage inspiration. The obsession with adventure and exploration has historical roots in the Victorian and Edwardian era, and pop culture roots in films set during the 20s and 30s, so a good deal of Fieldcore fashion is vintage inspired.,Media,[,]","Adventurecore,Paleocore,Cryptidcore",Beige,

Female Horror Game Protagonist Fashion,"This page is under construction.
,Tops,[,],There are multiple types of tops that fit into the aesthetic, and could lean in multiple directions. One of them uses ,tops that have ,Kawaii, details, found in Japanese fashions. They can feature ruffles, Peter Pan collars, lace trim, and ribbons around the neck. One popular trend is the ""Milkmaid Top,"" which is a faux two-pieces top that looks like a scoop neck combined with a contrasting lace camisole. 
,Other parts of the aesthetic borrow from trends of the early 2000s. ,Knit tops with contrasting collars, are one example, as well as the general trend of ,secretary-esque feminine blouses, that shares some overlap with Kawaii. ,Pieces from this era are often layered,. For example, lace-trimmed camisoles, small vests, and lingerie bustiers are worn under Henley shirts or on top of plainer blouses. 
,Other styles ,could lean more towards tactical fashion,, especially those who prefer the aesthetics of ,Resident Evil, over the more girlish ,Fatal Frame, outfits. In this style, knit turtlenecks and puffer vests are popular and copy the character Ashley from ,Resident Evil, (the character wearing the white vest in the info box image).  
,All of these ,tops are often worn untucked, and pulled over the bottoms, elongating the waist, which is also a trend from the early 2000s. 
,Bottoms,[,],Female Horror Game Protagonist fashion contains multiple references to schoolgirl fashion, as the protagonists are often of that age. Specifically, ,pleated miniskirts, solid or plaid,, are very popular and easy to find in comparison to many of the pieces from Japan. The short length also contributes to the ultra-feminine and sexy look that is common in Coquette fashion.  
,As previously discussed, a more practical look is any type of ,dark denim skirt,, which more sporty characters wear in horror games. 
,Note that ,pants/trousers are not worn in this aesthetic,, as that interferes with the shoes and legwear.  
,Accessories,[,],This aesthetic has a strong emphasis on socks and tights. There are many styles worn, but most common are ,knee-high or above socks,, which is related to schoolgirl uniforms.

Fashwave,"While the original Nazis had ties to Hugo Boss and Coco Chanel (style icons of the time and Chanel itself has only become more popular as time has progressed), the Fashwave crowd doesn't really have an established fashion style and will often look normal and unassuming, if not a bit dapper in some instances (like with Richard Spencer, the man who coined the term ""alt-right"" who appeared to be a respectable white nationalist until he was recorded during a particularly unhinged rant about Jewish people and all enemies to the alt-right.  There could be considered some crossover into the ,Incel, community (since often times, members of Fashwave or other alt-right communities will reach out to these people and attempt to recruit them into their numbers), but other than that, a lot of official Fashwave fashion aesthetics could tie into ,Nazi Chic, territory, but rather than it being done as a statement to offend and shock, it's a genuine attempt at promoting their values.

Fairy Kei,"Fairy Kei is centered around muted pastels and 80's revivalist cartoons and motifs such as My Little Pony G1, Care Bears, Rainbow Brite, vintage 80's Barbie, etc. The look is very much a ‘fantasy style’, emulating the worlds of 80's girls’ cartoons and early shoujo manga. It began with Tavuchi, founder of the vintage and repurposed vintage boutique SPANK!, as her personal style, and then the look took off from there. 
,Fabric is usually lightweight for dresses and skirts, such as the loose A-line dresses and the fluttery colored petticoats. Thick, fluffy sweaters, over-sized 80's sweatshirts; this is also the land from whence comes the mokomoko accessories craze, and stuffed animals are sewn onto sweaters and scarves, or as the usual purse. Dress length can be ankle length, knee-length or mini-skirt length; anything fluttery and flowy works. 
,The most important aspects of fairy kei are the vintage/fantasy world factor, and the color palette. Color is one of the most important features here, less so the structure or item. Pastels and neon-tinted pastels, or high-saturated pastels. Popular colors are pastel pink, baby blue, lavender, light yellow and in smaller doses, ‘white-with-black-dots’. Dark and overly bright colors are not allowed outside of accents. Several motifs and themes are often found in fairy kei as well: most notably the unicorn, followed by kittens, any vintage 80's toy or franchise, moons and stars, rainbows, and naturally sweets such as cotton candy and conversation hearts (the chalky American candy that say things like UR CUTE).

Ethno-Chic,"Ethno-Chic can be described as a fusion of traditional ethnic designs with contemporary fashion trends, resulting in a unique and eclectic aesthetic. Ethno-Chic fashion draws inspiration from different cultures, including African, Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern, and Latin American cultures. Ethno-Chic designers and fashion brands often incorporate traditional textiles, patterns, colors, and craftsmanship techniques into their clothing pieces. The most used colours in Ethno-Chic fashion are any natural colours. ,
Importantly, one of the key aspects of Ethno-Chic fashion is its emphasis on cultural appreciation rather than appropriation. Its purpose is to promote the knowledge and empowerement of historically marginalized cultures by incorporating their traditional elements respectfully and with permission into modern fashion. This is reflected in how the clothing is made, as Ethno-Chic fashion designers often collaborate with artisans from various cultural backgrounds. Additionally, Ethno-Chic has become popular in some oriental countries, like India or Sierra Leone.

E-Girl," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,E-Girl starterpack, 		 	, ,The E-Girl style is an aesthetic that emerged from the digital realm of social media platforms, particularly TikTok, blending influences from anime, gaming culture, and elements of 90s and early 2000s fashion. This style is renowned for its bold, expressive, and individualistic approach to fashion, celebrating self-expression, inclusivity, and online subculture. Another part of the fashion can be attributed to the high presence of Japanese pop culture on the internet. Outfits inspired by anime characters are also very common among E-Girls.
,The fashion worn by E-Girls is stylistically very similar to the various darker ,alternative, fashions.  An E-Girl's wardrobe is usually characterized by oversized band tees, cargo pants, chunky shoes, and a plethora of accessories such as chains and chokers. Predominantly are printed tops in black, pleated skirts, chain accessories, chokers, and platform shoes. 
,Hair can range from one's natural color to vibrant hues, often accessorized with clips and beanies. It's a blend of the rebellious spirit of punk with the cuteness of kawaii culture, making a distinctive and modern statement. E-girls will often style their hair into various and trendy hairstyles such as pigtails/twintails, space buns, straight bangs or having dyed hair/streaks; accessories like hairclips or scrunchies can be added. In addition, just as much value is placed on individuality.
,Makeup trends in this style often feature heavy, winged eyeliner, reddened or sickly eyeshadow with dark circles (or vibrant eyeshadow), extending the bottom of the eye with mascara, horizontal blush across the nose, and painted hearts or stars on the cheeks or near the eyes.

Dopamine,"All kinds of fashion styles can be seen in the aesthetic as long as they are in the typical refreshing colors. There are many different combinations of vibrant colors that contrast each other to harmonize the overall atmosphere and create a multi-level coordination effect in the outfits. Fluorescent tops, leg warmers, jelly sandals, fruit accessories, and positive vibes are  indispensable from Dopamine.

Dolly Kei,"An outfit must have a vintage look to be considered Dolly Kei. It is also characterized by a dark appearance, layering, lace, embroidery, animal fur (usually faux), as well as large accessories based around creepy fairytales. Some argue that large accessories are the most important part of this style, specifically lace chokers or even skulls. The fabrics in the outfits are usually heavy and in deep dark jewel-tones or black with a battered, worn, distressed appearance. 
,Dolly Kei outfits do not have to look cohesive. Clashing of patterns, colors, and accessories is encouraged. 
,Hairstyles tend to be natural and simple, with wavy hair and braids being common. Hair colors tend to be dark natural colors, including black, brown, and dark red.

Dollette,"Tops,[,],The tops of Dollette fashion are the most distinct feature of photos, as some tops are extremely popular and become highly sought-after items on the secondhand market. One of these are ,white eyelet cotton puffed sleeve milkmaid blouses., They are called milkmaid style because the bust area is gathered while the torso is fitted. This creates a sexy and feminine silhouette that resembles vintage fashion. One example of a milkmaid top that is popular is the Brandy Melville ""Blair"" top, which is known for being Tiktok-famous,[1],. 
,The Bebe ""milkmaid"" top sold for a high price, which influenced people to look for more of these ,""milkmaid tops."", These are not the true milkmaid tops described above. Rather, they are faux two-piece tops where it resembles a scooped neck sweater with a fake straight neckline ""tank"" in a contrasting color and contains girly details like ruffles, pintucks, and buttons. Many sellers on Depop ,import them from Japan,.
,However, more basic and buyable tops are doable in this aesthetic. ,Scoop neck jersey tees, (often long sleeved) ,with a lace camisole underneath, and peaking through, which is a copy of a 2000s trend, can be purchased anywhere. ,Pointelle jersey long sleeved tees,, especially with a floral pattern, ruching at the bust, lace trim, or ribbon have also become popular amongst mall brands after the Brandy Melville tops became desirable.

Deathrock,"The fashion is very distinct, combining Punk’s DIY-fashion with Goth’s dark and spooky aesthetics. (Although much Trad Goth is extremely similar in this regard.)
,In the 80s, the style was very broad, ranging from undead bride to army fatigues to Catholic iconography. By the 90s (thanks mostly to the band Cinema Strange) the modern variant of this style was born.
,The most notable feature of Deathrock fashion is the “deathhawk”, a teased or backcombed variation of the mohawk hairstyle with long sideburns. 
,Another feature of the fashion is ripped clothes and fishnets. A prominent piece of ripped clothing is that of a webbed-sleeve, made usually out of ripped tights, to recreated a spider-web look on shirts, jackets, pants and even boots. 
,Deathrockers utilize dramatic makeup, and some may even wear a lot of facial piercings (although not always).

Decopunk,"A lot of Decopunk fashion does tend to draw upon Dieselpunk's similar influences, but there's definitely more of a focus on looking fashionable and classically presentable than there is on the grittiness one would find within the Dieselpunk genre.

Dark Royaltycore," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Natalie Wynn, OUR DARK MOTHER, 		 	, ,Dark Royaltycore fashion encapsulates an array of styles that harmoniously blend opulence, decadence, and a touch of rebellion. This attire draws inspiration from various historical periods, fashioning a distinctive look that resonates with fallen nobility and junkies. The most colors are black, white, darker shades of green, brown, beige and petroleum blue. 
,Dark Royaltycore relies upon styling thrifted and passed-down items. You are a poor person, but you've also got an extravagant and maximalistic sense of style.
,Tops,[,],Puffy royal shirts take center stage, adorned with ornate embellishments like lace, ruffles, and puffed sleeves. Collars, whether layered under sweaters or making a statement with sailor-style designs, play a crucial role in this aesthetic. Sweaters, especially turtlenecks, contribute an autumnal and bookish essence, often featuring cable-knit or embroidery for added texture. Many fans of this aesthetic also wear strange, DIY cropped shirts. 
,Bottoms,[,],Formal dress pants crafted from sturdy materials like tweed dominate the bottom half of the attire. Patterns like check and herringbone, along with pleats, add dimension to these pants. Skirts come in pleated and check-patterned styles reminiscent of prep school uniforms, flowing mid-length or long skirts for elegance, and straight pencil skirts with button details that exude a mature aesthetic.
,Sometimes, more punkcore bottoms may be used, such as customised ripped baggy jeans that fall off your bottoms as you walk. It is normal for some enjoyers of this aesthetic to run errands in their underwear.
,Dresses,[,],Dresses are often layered, with pinafores and sleeveless options serving as foundational pieces beneath turtlenecks or collared shirts. While some interpretations embrace romantic ballgowns or Medieval-inspired milkmaid dresses, layering remains a key principle.
, 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,winter outfit, 		 	, ,Outerwear,[,],Outerwear takes a central role, particularly in the realm of luxurious coats that epitomize sophistication. These coats, adorned with intricate details and opulent fabrics, create a stunning visual impact. Their structure and texture showcase the aesthetic's decadence and intricate narrative. The choice of coat type alters the overall vibe—long coats in dramatic black exude intensity, while tailored coats radiate classic elegance. Fur coats are also often worn to mimic the russian whore aesthetic.
,Other outerwear choices are sweaters, cardigans, leather jackets, warmer button-ups, denim jackets and so on and so on. The sweater/cardigan can also be tied over shoulders to mimic the advertisements for American Prep brands.
,Shoes,[,],Leather men's dress shoes, such as brogues and wing-tips, align with the timeless and professional aesthetic. For an edgier touch, Doc Marten's black boots may be incorporated, seamlessly blending with the overall attire. Feminine ensembles often feature Mary-Janes or Victorian-esque footwear paired with long socks.
,Shoes with a platform over 10 cm are also very common, with most of them belonging to the brand Demonia.
,Accessories,[,],
Accessories play a pivotal role in both masculine and feminine branches of the aesthetic. Suspenders and intricate belts become signature elements, adding a touch of vintage charm. The accessories spectrum expands to include zippo-holding or sparkly belts, capturing the dual essence of utility and extravagance. Gender-neutral leather vintage bags, especially messenger bags, maintain the aesthetic's fusion of practicality and refinement., 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,hyperfem branch of Dark Royaltycore, 		 	, ,Jewelry flourishes in both branches, with the masculine side incorporating rings as essential pieces that contribute to the intricate narrative. Rings, stacked in various styles, convey a sense of maximalism and personality. The feminine side revels in an abundance of jewelry, allowing rings to take center stage. Solid silver or gold pendants are common when paired with turtlenecks, while brooches add character and vintage allure. The fusion of rings and other jewelry elements showcases the aesthetic's decadence and individuality.
,Hair and Makeup,[,],From the refined Oscar Wilde-inspired bowl cut with added length to the edgy grown-out buzzcut intertwined with small braids, each style fuses historical influences with modern twists. The artful use of bleach introduces contrast and dimension, while the shaggy mod style conveys a rebellious yet refined vibe. Middle parts exude symmetry and balance, while mullets provide a bold and intriguing dichotomy of short and long. With an emphasis on standout hair, these styles, including the option of extremely bleached white hair, amplify individuality without venturing into unnatural colors, accentuating the essence of Dark Royaltycore. 
,Dark Royaltycore's makeup captures a delicate balance of weariness and fragility, evoking a haunting allure that aligns with the aesthetic's themes of decay and fallen nobility. Achieving a tired look involves reddish eyebags, while pale skin with subtle blush enhances a sickly appearance. The eyes are often accentuated with eyeliner and white mascara. Cracked, bloody lips contribute to the morbidity.

Dark Gatsby,"Make-up --regardless of gender-- is precise.  
,Eyes are the focal point and fall into one of two expressions:
,(1) heavy kohl liner on the top and bottom lash line, exaggerated eyelashes, precise eyebrow shaping, and darker eyeshadow for the lid; or,,
,(2) pale lid with precise eyeliner on the top lash line and a natural eyelash darkened with mascara,
,Cheeks are flushed like in the 1920s with blush closer to the ""apple"" of the cheekbone and closer to the outer eye,
,Lip should always be a saturated red, berry, or brown matte,Dark Gatsby hair is always precise, well-groomed, and placed with the help of pomades, gels, or mousse. Traditionally, men keep the sides and back of the hair very close to the scalp. The remaining hair on top is either brushed back and held in place with product, or allowed to be ""fop-ish"" with a tumble of hydrated curls.
,The purpose of Dark Gatsby is to show how your gains --ill or nought-- have afforded you the luxuries that may have been denied you previously. It's a personal rebuttal against the ostracizing and restrictions of access due to race, class, sexual orientation, or gender. Being well-appointed in your personal appearance shows that you weren't given access, but you ,took, access and never asked permission. The statement pieces may be traditional (brooch, stick pin, earrings, suiting, etc.), but they're slightly gaudier than is standard and that's deliberate.

Dark Nautical,"Dark Nautical fashion is reminiscent of the 18th and 19th centuries and primarily broken up into two categories: feminine and masculine, but one shouldn't feel restricted to only one of these categories; gender isn't binary and dark nautical isn't either. 
,The style is beachy yet dark, with lots of blues and grays. In cooler weather, comfy sweaters, thrifted goodies like flannels or old sweaters, and hand-knit beanies, socks and gloves are suggested. Warmer weather necessitates breezy articles such as linen skirts and loose-fitting tops.

Dark Fantasy,"Dark fantasy elapses a broad amount of different fashion genres, but notably plays off of gothic, academia, pirate, and royal aesthetics. This is expressed through dark colors and heavy fabrics, such as wool, tweed, leather, suede, and velvet.

Dark Academia,"Dark Academia fashion emphasizes a high-class and vintage form of dress which is an amalgamation of different historical periods. The main inspiration for Dark Academic fashion comes from ,American Prep,, such as sweater vests or sweaters worn tied over the shoulders. This itself came from 1940s prep school uniforms, as seen in blazers, pleated skirts and regimental striped ties. Stereotypes surrounding humanities professors also influenced the fashion. Tweed blazers with elbow patches are one of the ""essentials"" of a Dark Academic wardrobe, as explained ,here,. Elements of the Victorian and Romantic fashion influence the more fanciful interpretation of the style, creating the look of a Gothic novel character or of an eccentric dandy. Autumnal fashion is also highly influential, as the associations with back-to-school clothing and bookishness are very connotative to the aesthetic. The most prestigious universities which this aesthetic centers on, such as those in the United Kingdom and New England in the United States, are in cooler climates, which is another reason why the fashion is autumnal.   
,One of the appeals of a Dark Academia wardrobe is the versatility of the pieces, as many of them could be mixed and matched. Like with school uniforms, this allows students/academics to not have to concern themselves too much with choosing their outfits in the day.,[7], Additionally, all of these clothes are commonly seen in a variety of stores, from thrift shops to in-person malls to designer brands. Searching for garments is thus easier, as it can fit multiple budgets and locales, as opposed to styles that have more specialized and alternative pieces that would be hard to find. 
,Usual fabric choices are more upscale, like cashmere, wool and tweed, but linen and cotton are also very common. Patterns are minimal, with plaids and argyle being the most common.
,Tops,[,],The shirts worn by Dark Academics can be masculine, such as with ,professional button-ups,, or more feminine with ,ornate blouses, that include details such as lace, puffed sleeves, and ruffles. Collars are incredibly important to the look, and they often are either layered under sweaters or used as a statement, such as in sailor-style shirts. 
,Sweaters, are also important and contribute to the autumnal and bookish character of the wearer. ,Turtlenecks, make the look sexier and more sophisticated, and sweaters provide ,an opportunity to add texture, to an outfit in the form of cable-knit and embroidery. ,Sweater vests, also add an opportunity to layer. 
,Bottoms,[,],Pants in the Dark Academia aesthetic are always ,formal dress pants,. They typically are in a sturdier material, such as tweed, and would sometimes feature patterns such as check and herringbone. Pleats are a common detail, and the fit around the ankles (flare, tapered, or straight) is up to personal preference. 
,Skirts are also featured in more feminine outfits. ,Pleated and/or check-patterned skirts, allude to prep school uniforms; ,mid-length or long flowing skirts, have a more elegant, even Victorian feel; and ,straight pencil skirts, often with button details,, make the look more mature and reference the 1930s-1940s.
,Dresses,[,],Dresses are often worn as layering pieces. ,Pinafores and sleeveless dresses, are often worn under turtlenecks or collared shirts. These can include the same details as skirts, and are more basic for the sake of layering, rather than as a statement. 
,However, interpretations of Dark Academia that include ,Royalcore, can include romantic ballgowns, and ,Cottagecore, interpretations with Medieval-inspired milkmaid dresses.
,Outerwear,[,],Outerwear is the most prominent feature of Dark Academic fashion because ,blazers, cardigans, and different kinds of coats, are the most evocative of sophistication and professionalism. Outerwear is also extremely autumnal and an important feature of historical and vintage fashion in general. 
,The details in outerwear ,add texture and structure, to an outfit. The fabrics used here are incredibly important and tends to be of high-quality wool tweed. The ,fit of the outer layer is incredibly important because it makes the silhouette,. In the community, it is largely either tailored to the wearer's body to look clean and professional or oversized to have a more cozy or chic look. 
,The type of outerwear worn with an outfit can greatly change the connotations and style associated with it. Like sweaters, cardigans can add texture and tends to be a softer and more casual interpretation of the aesthetic (especially if over-sized). Meanwhile, long coats, especially in black, add intimidating drama. Blazers, typically associated with men's businesswear, are the most common type of outerwear. 
,The ,sweater/cardigan can also be tied over shoulders, to mimic the advertisements for American Prep brands.
,Shoes,[,],The shoes tend to be ,leather men's dress shoes, such as brogues and wing-tips. These match the timelessness and professionalism of the aesthetic and match the understated neutrality of the other formal pieces. 
,However, ,Doc Marten's black boots, may be worn to add an edginess to the outfit. This brand is actually trending across many aesthetics throughout youth fashion in the 2020s, and its utilitarian nature makes it avoid looking incongruous to the rest of the clothing. 
,In more feminine outfits, ,Mary-Janes or Victorian-esque footwear, such as boots could be worn. These are ,typically matched with long socks, to match other prep-school styled pieces such as pleated skirts.  
,Accessories,[,],Dark Academia tends to feature ,gender-neutral leather vintage and rectangular bags, (mostly messenger bags). These match the professional aesthetic of formal outerwear and the utilitarian, no-frills versatility of the rest of the wardrobe. However, ,tote bags with an art print, could be used for a more casual look while still fitting in with the aesthetic. 
,Accessories that accompany suiting, such as ties, pocket squares, and cufflinks are common. These should follow the same elegant and minimal aesthetic and fit the color palette. Unlike in some other outfits, such as in certain magazine editorials, these accessories aren't meant to stand out and add splashes of color that make it look daring.  
,Leather belts, are an extremely popular component in Dark Academia outfits. It connects to vintage fashion, as this was generally worn throughout history, but lessened in popularity in more contemporary times as fashion became more casual. Likewise, ,suspenders, have the same vintage connotation, but aren't as common in Dark Academia because of the popularity of sweaters.  
,Glasses, match the aesthetic because of its association with bookishness. These have classic and mature styles, such as in wire, dark metal, or tortoise-shell frames.
,More feminine outfits can feature jewelry, but this is understated and timeless, with simple gold and silver. ,Solid silver or gold pendants, are especially common when worn with turtlenecks. ,Brooches, are a common piece to add character flare to an outfit and are often cameos, skulls, insects, and other vintage things associated with the visuals. Rings, however, are an opportunity for exploring maximalism because many people ,stack different ring styles, on top of each other.    
,Hair and Makeup,[,],The hairstyles associated with the aesthetic are fairly loose in that ,multiple styles can fit,, from neat bobs to long and disheveled. However, it is noted that alternative hairstyles, such as buzzed hair or hair dyed in unnatural colors, tend to be left out from the aesthetic because of its incongruity with the vintage aesthetic.  
,The makeup associated with Dark Academia should be either ,minimal and natural or mysterious, almost ,femme fatale,-like,. Natural (or no) makeup is associated with the more utilitarian and masculine forms of dress. The more obvious makeup follows the color palette of Dark Academia with burgundy lipstick and eyeshadow in grays and neutrals. Some common trends of contemporary makeup (heavy winged eyeliner, shimmer, contouring, etc.) tend to look mismatched to the more vintage type of fashion in the aesthetic and aren't used. 
,Likewise, nails should be kept short and natural, but can be painted in neutral and dark colors and without too much ornamentation such as sparkles.

Cyberprep,"While cyberpunk fashion is inspired by counter-cultural outfits, cyberprep clothing draws on ,New Wave,, ,Y2K, aesthetic and contemporary fashion.

Cyberpop,"The key difference between ,Cybergoth, and Cyberpop fashion is that the latter mainly focuses on bright colors. Cyberpop also contains more elements of ,Atompunk, in the usage of retro-future rings and shoulder puffs. The 1990s and early 2000's future fashion aesthetic found in ,Y2K, is also influential. The color palette is similar to the one used in the ,Raver, aesthetic, but differs in that natural materials are never used. Both ,Raver, and Cyberpop fashion makes use of neon colored UFO pants, both wide legged and draw string.

Cyberpunk,"Main Article: ,Techwear,
,Cyberpunk fashion is heavily influenced by films like Johnny Mnemonic, Blade Runner, and The Matrix and could be interpreted as being ""futuristic gothic fashion"" and involves trench coats, boots, shiny black clothing, colored ""dreads"" that women might wear, etc. Although, Techwear is not the only notable fashion influence when it comes to Cyberpunk. Warcore and Darkwear also heavily inspire the idea of Cyberpunk fashion. Warcore takes war-like / associated motifs like utility vests, cargo pants, and maximalism in its abundance of buckles, straps, and other utility accessories. Darkwear on the other hand is more minimalistic. Darkwear takes streetwear silhouettes and flips them into darker, usually monochrome, pieces and outfits. It's similar to Warcore, but as if you've taken away the maximalism aspect.

Cyberghetto,"Fashion-wise, Cyberghetto can be strongly reminiscent of the ,Y2K, aesthetic, featuring very bright and bold colors mixed with very shiny elements that can see cuts of black mixed in to make the bold styles really stand out.  However, unlike, the Y2K aesthetic (where its usage is generally unironic and is what people thought the future would look like), their usage in Cyberghetto has a slightly darker twist to them, possibly leaning some into ,Cybergoth, territory, but without the Gothic undertones.

Cybercore,"Cybercore is a very new concept, but with certain brands that were popular at the time still existing, one could easily predict these brands could potentially play a huge role in Cybercore. Also, it should be noted a lot of ,Holosexual, aesthetics and style can turn up in Cybercore fashion as well (due to its usage in futuristic fashion at the time). Low-rise skirts are usually really popular in this aesthetic. Japan's Fruits magazine, published from 1997 to 2017, has also been popular among Y2K fashion revivalists.

Denim jackets and hooded sweatshirts with sewn-on patches, or vests covered in studs, spikes and band patches are characteristic elements of the crust punk style of dress or pants covered in band patches. They sometimes wear dreadlocks.

Cult Party Kei,"Cult Party Kei is primarily a second-hand/thrifted fashion. It’s best to use 2-3 colors in an outfit. Most outfits are white or cream for the most part, but adding touches of bright red or pastels (e.g. pastel pink, lilac) is common. For example, pastel nightgowns are a staple piece. However, a high proportion of pastels in an outfit can make it look  ,Fairy Kei,, so be sure to focus on whites or pastels on the less vibrant side. Quilts used for jackets and skirts and yo-yo accessories are usually very colorful though.  
,The silhouette is usually slightly baggy/loose fitting, but with a loosely defined high waist (around your natural waist line or higher) but not with a tightly belted waist. Shirts are usually tucked under skirts/pants, but not always, and most of the time the neckline is high. Layering can be as few as a shirt, camisole, skirt or shorts and peignoir, or even just a shirt and a skirt, and up to however many layers you want.
,Poofy skirts are the most popular; tiered, ruffled, lacey, mesh, chiffon-y etc.  Usually they are mid- length or short, but sometimes long ones are used. You can layer skirts to add more volume if needed. Vintage nylon petticoats are very popular, short ones can be tough to find, but longer ones can be worn high for an empire waist effect, and suspenders can be used to help keep the skirt up. Any skirt can be worn this way as well, manapyon does this often. Sometimes even pulling the skirt up to your armpits to make a dress style look can work. Gingham skirts and sort of kitchy country style skirts are fairly popular, especially in red. You can also do 90’s jeans or slightly baggy pajama-ish looking pants, they’re often rolled up at the hems. Jean shorts (cut off or with folded up hems) are used as well. Gingham pants are great too. Skirts can be worn over pants or shorts, especially short poofy petticoats.
,Definitely the most well known aspect of CPK is the peignoir. However it is not necessary to wear a peignoir to have a cpk outfit. Pretty much any vintage robe or peignoir will work for CPK, transparent ones are the most popular. Cotton ones are nice too, and usually easier to find in thrift shops. They are most often worn as the outer layer. However, they can also be worn under a cardigan, under a sweater or shirt, you can use your suspenders to keep them around your waist, and you can also tie the ends around your waist. Bed jackets, nightgowns and camisoles can also add some nylon to your outfit to make it look more CPK. Nightgowns can be worn as dresses, transparent ones are worn over a top/bottom or an opaque nightgown.
,Tights or thigh highs are almost always worn when wearing skirts or shorts. Printed tights are very popular, as well as semi opaque white tights. Lace tights are good as well. Black or white thigh highs are popular, either plain or with lace at the top. Printed thigh highs can work as well, ones like grimoire’s are good, or ones with cherries, bows or hearts. Lace trimmed ankle socks are very popular and a really good item to have. In warmer weather you can wear just ankle socks to keep cool.
,Most often Rocking horse shoes and Tokyo boppers are used. Sneakers are also really popular. Platform converse and the Vivienne westwood wing platforms are sometimes worn as well. A lot of the The Virgin Mary girls wear thrifted shoes in a lot of different usually 90’s styles. Mary janes, ballerina style flats, and most Lolita shoes are options as well.

,Crackhead fashion is less about what one wears, but what one ,does, with what one wears, but the general theme is chaos, chaotic and confusing get-ups, while not necessarily cursed.

Cottagecore,"There is a wide range of outfit styles that could fit into the Cottagecore aesthetic. Cottagecore fashion tends to fall into either a hyper-feminine, modernized interpretation of historical fashion or a more practical and cozy outfit that includes elements of whimsy.   
,The colors in Cottagecore tend to be naturally occurring or faded colours, including brown, baby pink, olive green, ivory, maroon, beige, ochre, dusty rose pink, light yellow, and baby blue. The fabrics are most often natural, such as in cotton, linens, knitted yarn, etc.   
,Many of these clothes are vintage and purchased secondhand, such as from thrift stores or vintage shops. This is in line with the appreciation for the environment and sustainability, as well as the fact that many Cottagecore pieces are highly sought-after because of their rarity in modern times and un-replicable unique design, such as in Gunne Sax dresses, Edwardian blouses, and antique aprons. However, as the aesthetic has become incredibly popular, it reached fast fashion, and many clothes found in mall brands have elements of Cottagecore motifs, especially with milkmaid tops.   
,Cottagecore fashion commonly involves:
,Longer, loose-fitting, flowy dresses and skirts often (but not always) reminiscent of housework wear from the 1900s-50s.,
,Large layered clothing (as stated above) big pockets, puffy sleeves, and button blouses,
,Patterns such as stripes, paisley, faded floral, and gingham.,
,Embroidered plants, animals, and insects.,
,Hand-crafted accessories such as simple jewelry and knitted hats, socks, and outerwear.,
,Shortalls/overalls,
,Lace,
,Longer, loose-fitting clothing,
,Laced corsets and bodices,Hair and Make-Up,[,],The hair and make-up of Cottagecore is either naturalistic, or in more fantastical interpretations, with fairy-like motifs. 
,Hair that is kept long, is associated with tradition and femininity. Long hair that is loose tends to be in waves or braids. 
,Accessories, such as bags, hats, jewelry and tech accessories that fit the cottagecore aesthetic tend to have visuals of flowers, trees, fairies, cute forest animals such as (deers, squirrels, butterflies), cabins & cottages, mushrooms, and fruits such as strawberries.

Coastal Grandmother,""",Being a coastal grandmother means wearing loose, breathable fabrics and doing strength training by shifting a full glass of Sauvignon Blanc from hand to hand. It means shelling peas on a chaise longue, or getting up at six to drink coffee with local cream in the still, cool promise of the morning. Coastal grandmother is not about conforming to male heterosexual expectations of female beauty. It is about being able to spend north of $70 on a single unscented pillar candle. Or, at least, cosplaying as someone who has money to spend on simple, good things. It is understated, wealthy-person dress up.,"",[1],

Classic Lolita,"The silhouette of Classic Lolita (more often than other styles), features an A-line skirt, with skirts usually being longer than what you would expect to see in other Lolita coordinates. Tea length skirts (skirts that come to the mid calf) are extremely common, with underskirts (a slip-like skirt with a lace ruffle at the very bottom) can be used to make a knee-length dress go to tea length.
,Coordinates often include heirloom details such as pintrucks and ruffles.
,Unlike other Lolita styles, flat shoes are very uncommon. In Classic Lolita, higher heeled shoes with straps as well as Victorian style boots are favored instead. 
The hair in Classic Lolita is kept natural in various shades of blonde, brown, and black. The hair can be styled in any way the person prefers. There are some who curl their hair, but it isn't very extreme. Makeup is preferred to be kept natural-looking as to appear mature.

Cholo,"As mentioned earlier, the Cholo culture owes a lot of its roots the Pachuco culture. The most popular form of fashion among the Pachuco community were zoot suits (which were popular with Black, Italian, Filipino, and Japanese-Americans as well). These suits would consist of high-waisted creased baggy pants, a outer layer coat (usually with large shoulder pads underneath), dress shoes, a fedora or Panama hat, a long tie, and pocket chain. The pachuco fashion would eventually heavily influence the fashion of the cholo style.
,Basic info,[,],A typical Cholo outfit usually contains sneakers, knee socks, creased loose-fitted khakis or jeans, oversized t-shirts, and flannels. Khaki work shirts, polos, hoodies, and sweatpants are commonly worn by Cholos as well. In addition, Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Chicago White Sox merchandise is popular with the community. 
,Footwear,[,],Nike Cortez, Chuck Taylors, Air Jordans, and Air Force 1s are the most common footwear among Cholos. Adidas Superstars, Vans, Puma Suedes, white Fila or Reebok sneakers, and black slippers are popular as well. Though Oxford and Derby/Brogue shoes used to be worn often up until the early 1990s. 
,Hair and headwear,[,],Traditionally, combed-back hair was popular with the Pachuco and Cholo culture. However, buzzcuts and shaved heads became common during the mid 1980s. Pony tails are often sported as well. Bandanas or hair nets are worn to keep hair in place. Beanies and Baseball caps are the most often-used headwear. Fedora and Panama hats used to be common back then, though they are nowadays worn by Veteranos.
,Music,[,]","Baddie,Chicha,Gangsta Rap,Hip-Hop","Black, Grey, White, Brown, Blue",
Christian Girl Autumn,"A lot of the fashion in this aesthetic is based off of knit sweaters, usually in warm and earthy colors, with jeans. The sweaters usually have simple designs like stripes, or they have be one solid color. Cardigans and jackets are also common if a sweater isn’t being worn. Knit hats, scarves, small purses, and boots, especially uggs, go along side the sweater and jeans. Sometimes, glasses can also be a part of the look.

City Pop,"Clothing,[,],City Pop fashion tends to be very opulent, high end, and draws a lot on the Yuppie fashion of the time (and so a lot of J-Preppy and Resort style turns up in City Pop fashion).  Indeed, a lot of City Pop fashion has served as inspiration for a lot of modern Japan-inspired aesthetics such as Vaporwave and Lo-Fi. ""Business Casual"" is a popular phrase in City Pop fashion. Later City Pop music from the mid-to-late 1980s also draws a lot of inspiration in its female fashion from the then-emerging ,Bodikon, subculture.
,Sailor Moon and California Crisis anime are prime examples of City Pop outfits.

Cherry Emoji Twitter,"CET fashion is either sexual and revealing or seemingly innocent yet erotic. Styles of dress vary depending on the individual. If someone is more covert about their sexuality, they may dress in a more cute and innocent way - contrary to their true nature. If someone if more overt with their sexuality, they may dress in sultry and revealing clothing, drawing people's eyes exactly where they want them to look. It truly depends on the individual though, and with that individual's boundaries in mind.
,Common elements of CET fashion are: 
,Lots of cherry prints on clothing,
,Reds, whites, and pinks as dominant outfit color,
,Tight or slightly risqué clothing,
,Summer outfits,

Cartelcore,"Pastel colors and 1980's aesthetics are generally the core of Cartelcore fashion, especially paired with gold jewelry (especially rings and chains). As far as actual clothing items, polos and button up shirts undone about 2 buttons down from the top to display the collarbones and chains, as well as pastel colored shirts and pants. Bullet proof vests, blue jeans, and a black short sleeve button up shirt however, are the most accurate representations of this aesthetic.

Bohemian,"They wear loose, colorful clothing and has been known as boho chic and hippie style. With their long flowing hair and rich, though threadbare fabrics, bohemians stand out in a crowd representing a colorful counterculture based on creativity. Chunky jewelry isn't uncommon. If you are emulating the bohemian aesthetic, please be mindful that although some have become 'accessories,' certain forms of dress and jewelry belong to indigenous people, whose ancestral culture and deserve to be respected and not appropriated. An often overlooked misuse of culturally significant pieces would be mimicry of American Indian dreamcatchers. Please allow yourself to be humble as you educate yourself about common cultural appropriation behaviors. If you are not descended from such cultures, then it is offensive to claim any tradition as your own.

Bodikon," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 	, ,Makeup,[,],Make-up included a light foundation, either a scarlet/dark red lipstick or a pink lipstick, and purple and blue eyeshadows in a single colour without any gradation. Designer lipsticks, such as a Gucci lipstick or especially a Dior pink lipstick, were very popular for this look. Eyeliner was black and clear, and there was heavy usage of mascara. Blush was diagonal and was orange, brown, or yellow. Bodikon women also had relatively thick (and slightly bushy) eyebrows -  it was mainstream to draw them much thicker than your own eyebrows. What was often done was drawing thick and dark straight eyebrows from the inside of the eyebrow to the end of the eyebrow using eye shadow, which couldn’t be as easily done with an eye pencil. Grey and dark brown eyebrow pencils were preferred for eyebrows around this time regardless of hair colour. After the Bubble burst, by the mid-1990s most women had very thin eyebrows - this process sped up when Tony Tanaka, a makeup artist, taught Japanese women the concept of trimming. In the Bubble period, women also had a strong    self-assertion, so it was said that it was better to have flashy make-up - it was not possible to easily look fashionable with a more “natural” make-up.

, 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 	, ,Hair,[,],Hairstyles, regardless of type, were generally always long, often reaching the woman’s knees or chest. At least 60% of women in their twenties kept their hair longer than their hip area by the early 1990s.The hairstyle that most Bodikon women wore by far throughout the Bubble was the ,“One-Length” or “Wanren” hairstyle,  (,Wanren, ,ワンレンボブ,). This was where the hair was cut all in one length to create a mature, professional look, and was (extremely) straight and long. This hairstyle was popularised by idols such as Chisato Moritaka, and directly contrasted the “Seiko-chan” look of the early 1980s (popularised by Seiko Matsuda). The “Wanren” hairstyle was often paired with bodycon dresses or a power suit to form the “,Wanren Bodikon,” (,ワンレン・ボディコン,) set - this “set” was a crucial look in the Bodikon style and is often one of the most famous mental images of the Bubble Economy to many      Japanese people. The Wanren Bodikon set attracted a lot of attention from onlookers during the time. Wanren hairstyles were often paired with a type of bangs known as “,Tosakamaegami”, (,とさか前髪,) bangs - literally “rooster hair” in Japanese - that could either be straight or curled, and sat at the top of the head. These bangs were upright “like chicken combs”, with the bangs slightly hung down and sprayed to keep them in place. As with any fashion that originated in the 1980s, hairspray was a Bodikon girl’s must-have and many women wrapped their bangs in curlers, slept, and then the next morning, used a hairspray to keep the bangs in place before going out. Wanren hairstyles didn’t always have Tosakamaegami bangs, but it was very common. However in the early 1990s during Bodikon’s final years the Wanren hairstyle did soften and Tosakamaegami bangs started to be worn with the Wanren hair less and less. This kind of look can be seen on Makino Tsukushi in the early 1990s volumes of Yoko Kamio’s Boys Over Flowers manga (Hana Yori Dango, ,花より男子,). Another type of popular Bodikon hairstyle was the “,Sauvage/Sovereign hairstyle,”  (,ワンレンソバージュ,). With Sauvage meaning “wild” in French, this was a natural wave perm hairstyle with fine waves throughout the hair and lots of volume. This hairstyle was extremely popular in the mid-to-late 1980s and can basically be described as a Wanren hairstyle that was curlier. As Bodikon fashion’s heyday years were before the “Chapatsu boom” (,茶髪/ちゃぱ,) of the mid-1990s (when dyed brown hair, nicknamed “Tea Hair” due to its colour, went mainstream), most Bodikon women had black hair. However during the ,radicalisation, of Bodikon around 1993-1994 (when Bodikon fashion started to become its most extreme and begin to resemble Gyaru), dyed shades of brown and even blonde hair became notable amongst Bodikon women, including famous AV idol Ai Ijima.
, 	, 	, 	, 		 		 		 	, ,Clothing,[,],With regards to clothing, the iconic Bodycon dress was extremely popular. It was generally considered the signature clothing piece of the style. It was almost always a neon or a generally colourful colour (the most popular colours were red or yellow) and was a mini dress that emphasized the lines of the body, capturing the femininity of the body. The Bodycon dresses of the Bubble period were characterised by being flashy and conspicuous, and the neon colours of the bodycon stood out even in central Tokyo at night. The more highly exposed bodycon dresses attracted a lot of attention from men. Encouraged by the “fitness craze” that was ongoing in 1980s Japan, young women dieted in order to wear bodycon and kept a sharp body. Bodikon women also had a high level of confidence in themselves by wearing bodycon. Bodycon dresses at the time were characterised by their clear appearance of cleavage, waist, and hip lines. The chest was often “wide open”, as women were encouraged during the Bubble to expose their cleavage, and the length of the skirt along the hip line was up to the thighs. It was initially only worn in discothéques and disco halls, before then being popularised as fashion wearable on the street by around December of 1985. Many Bodycon dresses at the time were sleeveless, and so there were a variety of bras worn by Bodikon women. Some women wore strapless bras, and some even wrapped bras with “bleached” colours to make the shape of the bust look good. Colours and patterns of bodycon dresses varied, but the most popular was a vivid bright red that matched the colour of the lips with the colour of the bodycon. In addition, there were many flashy colours such as yellow, pink, and purple, and by the early 1990s it was common to see women wearing “wild pattern bodycon”, such as leopard prints and zebra patterns. Sequin bodycon dresses were very popular, with blue sequins being especially popular. Women wore Bodycon dresses for a number of reasons; these included attracting rich men, not caring about men’s opinions at all and going all out crazy, or feeling confident and self-assertive in clothes that flattered their bodies. 
,With regards to shoes, they were almost always high heels, usually being black and décolleté in leather with medium heel for a classy look. 
, 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,A modern Bodikon woman flaunts her “Juli fan” for the camera, 		 	, ,Furs, feather boas and a lot of gold jewellery would be worn alongside Bodycon dresses, often with luxury bags (such as Louis Vuitton or Versace bags) and gold chains. Chunky gold jewellery was very common and would be worn all over the chest area of the  Bodikon woman. 
,There were numerous styles of Bodycon dresses, including the “Sexy Bodycon” style of string-bikinis and transparent dresses popular in clubs but inappropriate to wear on the street, but the most popular style, particular for daytime usage, was the One-Line style (,ワンレン・ボディコン,),  which was a little bit more conservative than today’s Western bodycon, but was intended to be a “mature” and “sophisticated” style with a closely-fitting dress, or a suit-set, that was usually in one bright colour and uniform enough to pass for office-wear. The One-Line style (or ,Wanren Bodikon, in Japanese) was the type preferred for the daytime activities of Bodikon gals, and is also known as the ,Daytime Variant.,  The One-Line style included the meticulous usage of the “power suit”, often colourful and with shoulder pads. This was considered a status symbol of business success for women, a highly desirable attribute amidst the success of the Bubble Economy. Sometimes a picture pattern, such as a pattern of Tokyo’s neon lights, would be worn on a power suit, but it was not super common. Power suits were worn nearly everywhere in daily life, from job interviews to nightlife to housework.
, 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,In this image from a December 1992 event in Juliana’s Tokyo, the difference between “Sexy Bodycon” (on the left) and the One-Line style (on the right) is clear. Bodikon women usually dressed in both., 		 	, , 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,A circle of Bodikon women at Avex Rave, 		 	, ,“Sexy Bodycon” (also known as the ,Night-time Variant,) became the prevailing Bodikon style by 1993 - with extreme style choices. Women wore neon-coloured string bikinis, transparent dresses as well as neon miniskirts, microbikinis and spandex, as well as extremely tight bodycon dresses with very short hemlines and often cut with revealing sections. By 1993-1994, neon-coloured PVC clothing, such as hot pink PVC miniskirts, were also highly popular in the disco scene. Pasties and string panties were often worn, sometimes even on the street. Women also wore large, customised belts and had long, often white gloves for a glamorous effect. Some of the more “radical” women - especially at Akasaka’s Ronde Club - even brought whips as dance accessories. Tanning was a major part of the radical look - along with dyed blonde and brown hair. The “Sexy Bodycon” look was popularised by influential celebrities in the Japanese media at the time - these include Ai Iijima, an AV idol who featured prominently on the late-night TV show “Gilgamesh Night” and  was a mainstream celebrity in Japan - men wanted her and women tried desperately to copy her sexy antics. Additionally, there was also Natsuki Okamoto, a race girl, who helped to popularise this sexy version of the bodycon look, even adding her own touch to the style with the “high-leg” look, which was a bathing suit cut to reveal all the thigh and hip. By mid-1994, Bodikon women were also utilising chokers in their look, and inspirations for nightlife clothing borrowed from popular anime characters such as Sailor Moon in style. 
, 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 			,Spandex miniskirts - a popular look in early 1994, 		 	, ,Miniskirts were also popular, being usually paired with long stockings and gold chains, and were popular in both summer and winter.

Belgian New Beat,"New Beat Fashion,[,],The fashion associated with this scene is mainly attributed to the New Beat movement during the late 1980s,[2],. It was inspired by churches and ,Gothic, fashion, with the main colours used being black, white and sometimes yellow. The clothing was meant to be provocative as well, taking inspiration from ,BDSM, fashion with elements such as leather and fishnets. The most iconic motifs seen on New Beat outfits were the Smiley face and gravestone portraits (otherwhise called 'Bomma badges'). Given the latter, Bomma badges were oval ceramic portraits you could find in gravestones. As described by Idriz Jossa, one of the most iconic fashion designers of this movement, it was supposed to be extravagant and absurd but also 'nostalgic', in the sense that it's not the photo of a deceased person but a 'step back in time'. The Bomma badge became so fashionable that young people started stealing the emblems from cemeteries so they could wear them as necklaces. The clothing was mainly unisex and made with black lingerie fabric.
Other common characteristics of New Beat outfits were: 
,Cycling shorts,
,Knee socks,
,Bowler hats with crosses,

Australiana,"Australiana fashion is a style inspired by the unique cultural identity and natural beauty of Australia. It celebrates the country's landscapes, flora and fauna, indigenous heritage, and laid-back lifestyle. The fashion aesthetic incorporates elements that evoke a sense of nostalgia, irreverence, and the Australian larrikin spirit.
,Key motifs in Australiana fashion include opalescent and iridescent colors, contrasting color schemes, colors that don't traditionally go together, and white with splashes of bright primary colors. The use of native Australian flora and fauna prints, such as eucalyptus leaves, kangaroos, and koalas, is also common.
,The key values of Australiana fashion include a sense of nostalgia for Australia's cultural past, a laid-back and fun-loving attitude, and an occasional sense of irony. It embraces the country's relaxed and outdoorsy lifestyle, often incorporating beachwear, surf-inspired elements, and casual attire.
,Australiana fashion is related to other aesthetics such as Beach Bunny, Vacation Dadcore, Kiwiana (New Zealand-inspired fashion), Ozploitation (a style influenced by Australian film and pop culture), and Surf Crush (a fashion trend inspired by surf culture).
,Fashion Design Council of Australia,[,],From 1983 to 1993, the Fashion Design Council (FDC) made a significant impact on Australian fashion. Founded by Robert Pearce, Kate Durham, and Robert Buckingham, the FDC represented a collective of designers, models, and creatives who rejected European style conventions and drew inspiration from the vibrant party scene. Members like Martin Grant, Kara Baker, and Peter Morrissey embraced originality and idiosyncratic designs, with the FDC providing crucial support and promotion for emerging talents. The FDC's events, publications, and installations pushed the boundaries of Australian fashion and left a lasting legacy. Notably, Robert Pearce's magazine Collections, now archived by the National Gallery of Victoria, continues to serve as a cultural treasure, offering a captivating glimpse into the era's fashion and inspiring visitors with its editorial spreads.,[2],

Atompunk,"Atompunk fashion tends to draw heavy inspiration from how people in the 1950's/1960's viewed how the future was going to look, similarly to Raygun Gothic's fashion, so a lot of the outfits seen in pulp sci-fi of the time tend to be the primarily focus on Atompunk fashion, as well as t-shirts adorned with graphics invoking the covers of pulp sci-fi comic books of the time (which did tend to be rather sexually suggestive from time to time) being part of the Atompunk fashion aesthetic.

Androgynous,"Androgynous people dress or style themselves to look neither typically male nor female. The goal of dressing androgynously (on purpose) is to have an ambiguous gender appearance - where people don't automatically assume that you're male or female because it is difficult to know. This being said, biological sex does play a part in dressing androgynously - AFAB people dress typically more traditionally masculine and AMAB people typically dress more traditionally feminine. To reiterate, the androgynous aesthetic is not a gender identity, rather it is a form of dress.
,It’s a hybrid style of traditionally masculine and feminine clothing, makeup, and hair. The point is not to look like the opposite gender but to merge qualities of both in the style. It isn’t completely either, and has a history of being worn by straight people just as often as those in the gay community. (It’s also worn around the world by people of every race, culture, and creed.) 
,Historically, both men and women have indulged in wearing makeup, dying their hair, accents like ruffles and puffed sleeves, accessories like bracelets and necklaces, short and long hair cuts, tights/hose, pastels and the color pink, wearing suits, and wearing tunics, robes kimonos, or kilts. In truth, fashion and style has been notoriously fickle for centuries.  
,Regardless, it’s important to remember that not everything is flattering to everyone in terms of clothing. Tailoring and accentuating the natural lines of the body is usually what makes an androgynous style that is well-balanced between genders. 
,(It’s also important to note that being LGBTQ is not necessary to wear androgynous clothing, hair, or makeup. It’s a movement without bounds in gender or sexuality.) 
,Some 'androgynous fashion staples' would be things such as
,Loose, black, geometric clothing (these clothes' popularity has grown so much that it's sometimes labelled under the nu-goth aesthetic),
,Kilts. Surprisingly, these were once very popular punk staples (for either straight or queer people),
,Capes and hoods, particularity ones that can be worn in multiple different ways,
,Science fiction references are also very popular here, using things such as shiny fabrics and futuristic hairstyles and makeup looks,
,Men's watches - they're classy and, if you get the right type, they can look cyberpunk,
,Oxford shoes are very versatile and go with any outfit,

Alternative," 	, 	, 	, 		 			, 		 		 		 	, ,Alternative fashion is similar to that of punk and goth. Music is the central element, while fashion and visuals are optional. However, the label ""alternative fashion"" has evolved to mean any fashion outside of the mainstream. When most people think of alternative fashion, they think of ,Punk,, ,Goth,, or ,Emo, fashion. 
,Although alternative fashion is often a combination of these styles, it is not limited to them. For instance, ,Fairy Kei, could be considered alternative fashion since it is outside the mainstream. The alternative community generally supports small artists, and this sentiment often mirrored in the fashion, with places like ,Etsy, and small businesses being good places to shop for alternative clothes. Thrifting is also encouraged, along with DIY.

Afrofuturism,"Afrofuturist fashion draws very heavily upon traditional African prints and colors and adapts them to more modern and fashion-forward clothing styles to create a distinctly African identity, often looking like a ,real life super hero, in the process (but don't confuse the two, please; Afrofuturist fashion is a form of self-expression, not an attempt for them to become vigilantes). 
,In the 70s, American soul and funk artists adopted a quasi-futuristic, androgynous style similar to British Glam Rock but often with heavier metallic fabrics and accessories. (Artists like James Brown, George Clinton, and Sly and the Family Stone are key examples of this.) In the 80s, artists like Grace Jones and Afrika Bambaataa furthered this aesthetic in their own distinctly creative ways.
,While some Afrofuturists can draw explicitly from their particular tribal history for their fashion aesthetics, others (who may not be as well-versed in their national and tribal history; a common occurrence in African Americans due to the vast majority having their ancestors forced over to the States via the slave trade) are sort of left to their own devices and try to get the best approximation of their cultural heritage that they can be based on the traits of the different African tribes, which can lead to some absolutely breathtaking fashion that could, very well, be the future of fashion. One particular piece of advice for creating one's own Afrofuturist fashion is ""Listen to your spirit"".
